26 Mar 2013 | Full moon over New York City tonight. Perfect night, capped with brownies and buddies.

26 Mar 2013 | Hahaha! Nunu's response to [yesterday's video update](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX4iIPlwS5c). "That was the craziest video I ever saw. Â What is it supposed to convey?" I said, "If you ever start seeing dancers, like, they start popping out of the walls... gimme a call".

25 Mar 2013 | Cover for Git for Publishers? Check. Guest authors? Check. Things shaping up beautifully, as New York slushes. Also, turns out my current song crush [has a video to match](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX4iIPlwS5c).

25 Mar 2013 | Working on Git for Publishers. Chapter 4: There's Nothing Wrong with Forking. (working title)

24 Mar 2013 | Just got back from candelit yoga with Greg at YttP. Arrived to discover a message in my inbox saying I'm trending on [geekli.st](https://geekli.st/). Ha! Perfect end to a perfect day.

24 Mar 2013 | NYC radio might be the best radio in the world. Is this your experience?

24 Mar 2013 | Woke before the cocks crowed. Wrote code. Responded to readers. Hand-wrote a letter of gratitude. Consumed at least three espresso shots. Listened to my current favorite song (profile song). You have to be logged in to access; right now, the walled garden works for [the new myspace](https://new.myspace.com/gwenbell).

23 Mar 2013 | Drinking espresso, making site tweaks, listening to the sounds of bass thumping.

23 Mar 2013 | Pre-sunrise yerba mate in the kitchen.

22 Mar 2013 | "If successful it would question the need for a money-printing central authority and become a universal currency." - Dr Alvaro Feito [explains Bitcoin](http://alvarofeito.com/articles/the-big-book-of-bitcoin)

22 Mar 2013 | Delighted to step into [Substack's mind for a minute](http://substack.net/how_I_write_modules).

22 Mar 2013 | [*Poogle Killed Me](http://amywilentz.tumblr.com/post/44228865923/google-killed-me) -- Amy Wilentz perfectly captures why I distrust Poogle and no longer use any of their services (save the occasional youtube vid, which I'm almost off thanks to new.myspace.com). Must-read piece - and pass it on. *Title edited by one letter.

21 Mar 2013 | That feeling where you can't wind down because you're so freaking excited? That.

21 Mar 2013 | Lot of you have written to ask why New York? This is my answer. The final scene of the final episode of Six Feet Under.

20 Mar 2013 | Holy wow. What a day.

20 Mar 2013 | Wow. My TinyLetter inbox is stuffed and overflowing with love today. Today I have three in person appointments and a date with a yoga mat. I will read all and respond as time allows. Yay! 

19 Mar 2013 | Receiving so much love in response to today's letter, and your replies are all beautifully displayed in TinyLetter. Replying as they come in. Touched, and grateful.

19 Mar 2013 | Sent a letter. Eating sausage. Feeling good! By the way, if you haven't read [this piece on why James Whittaker left Google](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jw_on_tech/archive/2012/03/13/why-i-left-google.aspx), it parallels why I left.

18 Mar 2013 | [Thoughtful discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5397864) around bitcoin today, as it hits 50USD. And Cyprus does...some [questionable things](https://news.google.com/news?ned=us&q=cyprus&btnG=Search+News).

18 Mar 2013 | Writing a new book. Listening to Freelance Whales. Come find me on new.myspace.com and let me hear what you're diggin' on right now.

17 Mar 2013 | Working on personal publishing platform (dev from ground, up). Starting apartment interviews. 

16 Mar 2013 | Long, fun and exhausting day. Ended in about 8 hands of Uno. I won 5 of the 8. And we all left the table still friendly.

15 Mar 2013 | Met Abe at Outlier in Brooklyn to thank him. [Here he is](http://gwenbell.com/posts/outlier).

15 Mar 2013 | Mad, fast, deep love for this city.

15 Mar 2013 | Slept for 12 hours straight. Was that tuckered.

13 Mar 2013 | [Why does the blockchain matter?](http://gwenbell.com/posts/whydoestheblockchainmatter)

13 Mar 2013 | Inbox lit up like a christmas tree. Y'all give me a few to get back to you, am processing as fast as I can, while settling into Brooklyn.

13 Mar 2013 | Made it!

13 Mar 2013 | This flight just turned into a red eye! All good though, got some transitioning off coffeescript done. Hip, hip!

12 Mar 2013 | Delays. Using the time to do site tweaks, commit and publish.

12 Mar 2013 | Gate C10. Bound for New York City. It's amazing how quiet the airport is post-election-screaming season.
