22 Mar 2013 | "If successful it would question the need for a money-printing central authority and become a universal currency." - Dr Alvaro Feito [explains Bitcoin](http://alvarofeito.com/articles/the-big-book-of-bitcoin)

22 Mar 2013 | Delighted to step into [Substack's mind for a minute](http://substack.net/how_I_write_modules).

22 Mar 2013 | [*Poogle Killed Me](http://amywilentz.tumblr.com/post/44228865923/google-killed-me) -- Amy Wilentz perfectly captures why I distrust Poogle and no longer use any of their services (save the occasional youtube vid, which I'm almost off thanks to new.myspace.com). Must-read piece - and pass it on. *Title edited by one letter.

21 Mar 2013 | That feeling where you can't wind down because you're so freaking excited? That.

21 Mar 2013 | Lot of you have written to ask why New York? This is my answer. The final scene of the final episode of Six Feet Under.

20 Mar 2013 | Holy wow. What a day.

20 Mar 2013 | Wow. My TinyLetter inbox is stuffed and overflowing with love today. Today I have three in person appointments and a date with a yoga mat. I will read all and respond as time allows. Yay! 

19 Mar 2013 | Receiving so much love in response to today's letter, and your replies are all beautifully displayed in TinyLetter. Replying as they come in. Touched, and grateful.

19 Mar 2013 | Sent a letter. Eating sausage. Feeling good! By the way, if you haven't read [this piece on why James Whittaker left Google](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jw_on_tech/archive/2012/03/13/why-i-left-google.aspx), it parallels why I left Google.

18 Mar 2013 | [Thoughtful discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5397864) around bitcoin today, as it hits 50USD. And Cyprus does...some [questionable things](https://news.google.com/news?ned=us&q=cyprus&btnG=Search+News).
