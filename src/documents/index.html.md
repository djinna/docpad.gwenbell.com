7 Apr 2013 | New beat: [Chinks](http://gwenbell.com/posts/chinks)

2 Apr 2013 | Unless you're Nunu, you won't hear from me for a few days. Going under to finish Git for Publishers. Check my [commits](http://github.com/gwenbell) if you're wanting to play in code! Or find me on [http://socialno.de](http://socialno.de/) (accessible by CJDNS) where I'll be blowing off steam for five minutes per day.
 
1 Apr 2013 | This city. Is. 

1 Apr 2013 |  Moved into new apt in Bed-Stuy. Settling in with yoga and the sounds of a construction crew. 

31 Mar 2013 | Moving into my new apartment. In New York City. This is a first. Eeeeee!

31 Mar 2013 | Started the day finding 5 of the 48 Easter eggs. Then, won 3 Uno games in a row. Now, making commits to Git for Publishers on Gitboria. While eating banana chocolate chip pancakes, listening to Money Trees. Ya bish. 

30 Mar 2013 | That was...officially...the best day of all time.

29 Mar 2013 | Programming. Writing. Eating bacon cheeseburgers cooked by one master cheeseburger artist. Dancing around to Radiohead. Napping with two cats. Tubular Friday.

28 Mar 2013 | Walked through Hasidic Jewish Williamsburg last night. One of the most surprising, surreal things I've done in some time. Read [Escape from the Holy Shtetl](http://nymag.com/news/features/48532/) when I got home - beautiful piece, frame.

28 Mar 2013 | "One customer in a queue in Nicosia told the BBC's Tim Willcox he was withdrawing the allowed daily amount of 300 euros ($383; £253) but would take out all of his money if he could." [Tim Willcox for the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21963462)

28 Mar 2013 | "Bitcoin isn't tied to any commodity-besides trust. As a statement on the global economy, Bitcoin is hilarious. As a currency for the disenfranchised and distrustful, it's as serious as can be." [Paul Ford at Bloomberg Businessweek nails it](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-03-28/bitcoin-may-be-the-global-economys-last-safe-haven#p2).

26 Mar 2013 | Full moon over New York City tonight. Perfect night, capped with brownies and buddies.

26 Mar 2013 | Hahaha! Nunu's response to [yesterday's video update](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX4iIPlwS5c). "That was the craziest video I ever saw.  What is it supposed to convey?" I said, "If you ever start seeing dancers, like, they start popping out of the walls... gimme a call".

25 Mar 2013 | Cover for Git for Publishers? Check. Guest authors? Check. Things shaping up beautifully, as New York slushes. Also, turns out my current song crush [has a video to match](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX4iIPlwS5c).

25 Mar 2013 | Working on Git for Publishers. Chapter 4: There's Nothing Wrong with Forking. (working title)

24 Mar 2013 | Just got back from candelit yoga with Greg at YttP. Arrived to discover a message in my inbox saying I'm trending on [geekli.st](https://geekli.st/). Ha! Perfect end to a perfect day.

24 Mar 2013 | NYC radio might be the best radio in the world. Is this your experience?

24 Mar 2013 | Woke before the cocks crowed. Wrote code. Responded to readers. Hand-wrote a letter of gratitude. Consumed at least three espresso shots. Listened to my current favorite song (profile song). You have to be logged in to access; right now, the walled garden works for [the new myspace](https://new.myspace.com/gwenbell).

23 Mar 2013 | Drinking espresso, making site tweaks, listening to the sounds of bass thumping.

23 Mar 2013 | Pre-sunrise yerba mate in the kitchen.

22 Mar 2013 | "If successful it would question the need for a money-printing central authority and become a universal currency." - Dr Alvaro Feito [explains Bitcoin](http://alvarofeito.com/articles/the-big-book-of-bitcoin)
