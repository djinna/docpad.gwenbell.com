2 Apr 2013 | Unless you're Nunu, you won't hear from me for a few days. Going under to finish Git for Publishers. Check my [commits](http://github.com/gwenbell) if you're wanting to play in code! Or find me on [http://socialno.de](http://socialno.de/) (accessible by CJDNS) where I'll be blowing off steam for five minutes per day.
 
1 Apr 2013 | This city. Is. 

1 Apr 2013 |  Moved into new apt in Bed-Stuy. Settling in with yoga and the sounds of a construction crew. 

31 Mar 2013 | Moving into my new apartment. In New York City. This is a first. Eeeeee!

31 Mar 2013 | Started the day finding 5 of the 48 Easter eggs. Then, won 3 Uno games in a row. Now, making commits to Git for Publishers on Gitboria. While eating banana chocolate chip pancakes, listening to Money Trees. Ya bish. 

30 Mar 2013 | That was...officially...the best day of all time.

29 Mar 2013 | Programming. Writing. Eating bacon cheeseburgers cooked by one master cheeseburger artist. Dancing around to Radiohead. Napping with two cats. Tubular Friday.

28 Mar 2013 | Walked through Hasidic Jewish Williamsburg last night. One of the most surprising, surreal things I've done in some time. Read [Escape from the Holy Shtetl](http://nymag.com/news/features/48532/) when I got home - beautiful piece, frame.

28 Mar 2013 | "One customer in a queue in Nicosia told the BBC's Tim Willcox he was withdrawing the allowed daily amount of 300 euros ($383; Â£253) but would take out all of his money if he could." [Tim Willcox for the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21963462)

28 Mar 2013 | "Bitcoin isn't tied to any commodity-besides trust. As a statement on the global economy, Bitcoin is hilarious. As a currency for the disenfranchised and distrustful, it's as serious as can be." [Paul Ford at Bloomberg Businessweek nails it](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-03-28/bitcoin-may-be-the-global-economys-last-safe-haven#p2).

26 Mar 2013 | Full moon over New York City tonight. Perfect night, capped with brownies and buddies.
