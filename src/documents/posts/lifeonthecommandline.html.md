"How zefuck am I going to get Linux on this machine?" he asked me like I must be a Mac Genius just because I'm American.

He brandished his MacBook Pro in one hand, was topless and his hair was a tousled mess. I glanced over his shoulder at the room behind him. The guy appeared to moonlight as either a bartender or stripper, or both.

"I don't know," I said, looking at his Pro, "but I have an Air and I've been wondering the same thing."

"Well, I've been trying to for hours. Maybe it's time to give it up."

I asked him what he was trying to get on his Mac, and why. He told me he was sick of the Apple operating system getting dumber, and he was trying to get Ubuntu installed. Then he walked back into his room and shut the door.

**Berlin 2012**

That was Berlin, summer of 2012. I was running low on cash, supporting myself as a traveling writer. I drank beer instead of water at my [expat buddy's](http://paulsalamone.com/) suggestion. "Cheaper than water," he said, acknowledging the decision may or may not lead to alcoholism. He may or may not have been joking.

I kept moving into progressively dingier, more desperate parts of the city. 

Started out in Prenzlaur Berg, a decidedly twee, baby-making part of Berlin. Ate waffles every other meal. Then I was on to Wedding, where many of the sub-15 male inhabitants and their adult counterparts shaved elaborate tribal symbols into the backs of their heads. 

In the final month in Berlin I found myself in some 'burby place in Mitte, on the outskirts of Kreuzberg. Which is where the Italian-French looking guy stands now, frustrated as I am with his Apple machine.

**Fellow traveler, I agree**

This traveler was poking at the seeds of my own discontent. I wanted to make the switch off Apple software, while keeping the hardware. So I did.

At the end of 2012, I installed Ubuntu, a distribution of Linux, onto my 2011 MacBook Air. I didn't keep the Mac operating system around - I run on Linux, all the time.

The added benefit of this is I now get my hands on the command line from the moment I start my day. 

**From intimidation to confidence**

I used to be intimidated when I saw a terminal window. Anytime I'd see a developer doing something that made a lot of letters and numbers fly by, I assumed it must be magic. 

Now that I do the same thing all day, I know that the notion I held is true and not true. There _is_ something magical to working on the command line. But it's not so magical you, too, can't do it.

Here's how I got from that moment in Mitte - swapping frustrations with a fellow traveler - to today, spending six plus hours on the command line in Ubuntu a day - in under six months. I'm not saying you follow these instructions, and I'm 99% sure if you do, you'll void your Apple warranty. That's part of the fun.

**Install Ubuntu on your MBA**

Alright, here's the recipe.

_Warm Up_

+ Purchase a 4gb usb stick. They're dirt cheap, like $10 at Target. (This won't work without a stick.)
+ Backup your hard drive.
+ Set aside a long stretch of time, with which to wrestle with your machine
+ Be in possession of a solid internet connection

_Action_ 

+ Create a [bootable USB stick](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx)
+ Put [rEFIt](http://refit.sourceforge.net/) on there
+ Download the [Ubuntu iso](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
+ I had to repeat some of these steps, so be patient if it doesn't work the first time

_Then_

+ If you get stuck, [ask for help](http://askubuntu.com/)

I don't know if the Frenchtalian ever got Ubuntu on his Pro. I hope he did - there's a whole 'nother world out here.
