It was down to two electives. I knew one had to be music related - chorus or band. The other was either going to be computer skills or ROTC.

Finally, I decided. I knocked at the door to the lieutenant's office. He had a sweet setup, at the end of a hall, huge windows that I think he always kept the blinds shut on. He wore his usual khaki suit, polished shoes. "Lieutenant, I'm not taking ROTC again this year. I've decided on the computer class instead," I said. I could feel the heat rising from my shoes to my face.

I remember him being calm about it. Maybe he said he understood. I'd definitely expected a worse reaction than I got.

Why I'm learning to program
---

I love spending time with developers and in the startup world. I've been present through the acquisition of startups, and seen what happens when two code bases merge. I've seen the heartache and frustration that ensues. I'm interested in programming because I want to see problems solved in ways I would solve them. I'm interested in programming, and since last year have been learning to program, because I learned to hold still, be quiet and hold a problem in my mind for long enough that I know now I can become a programmer.

I'm on this journey not to be a rock star developer. I've met a few rock star developers, and each time I've thanked them for the work they do. I admire programmers who stick with problems until they're solved. I look up to developers who turn problems inside out to find a new solution to an old, seemingly impossible problem.

Cryptography

Last year when I talked with Mike Hearn about Bitcoin, that really jumpstarted me. Then I talked with Isaac in Kansas City about the Free Network Foundation. At one point I talked with Zooko in Boulder about Bitcoin, and his project in the world of cryptography. All three are working on things that fascinate me. The way they think has pushed me to extend myself in this way.

How I started programming
---

I opened up Codecademy, took a refresher on CSS3 and HTML5. Once done, I started learning JavaScript (ECMAScript). I happened upon [Learning to Love JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seX7jYI96GE) and decided to stay with it. 

Once I had a rudimentary grasp of JavaScript I started learning Node.js. Once I had a rudimentary grasp of that, I began building something. I'd been looking for years for a CMS that worked for my needs. I found it in Docpad and deployed this site using it.

What I hope to do

The people in tech I respect take a problem and work at it until there's an effective, and even elegant, solution. I aspire to do the same.
