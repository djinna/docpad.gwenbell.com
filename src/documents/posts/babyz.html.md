I met Toddler Z two years ago this month. I'd flown into New York for the [99% conference](http://www.behance.net/gallery/99-Conference-Materials-2011/3872017).

Z was barely born at the time and his mama, who runs the Schoolhouse here in Brooklyn, brought him to the Ace hotel to introduce him. While slept we shared a bread and cheese plate and laughed and talked. Z was brand brand new and his eyes maybe weren't even open yet. 

Today, I was losing a hand of Uno when he and his mom came in. He didn't have to be carried this time. He burst into the room - a full two years later, here he is. All independent and taking on the world.

I lost that hand of Uno. 
And couldn't have cared less.
