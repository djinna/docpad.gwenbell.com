You can't lie about your musical tastes. If what you listen to on repeat is songs about beating the windows out of your ex-lover's car, it says something about how you're feeling or what you're needing.

The new Myspace is, as of this month, in public beta. [Express](http://expressjs.com/applications.html) powers it, and you can tell. Because it's powered by Node, it says something. The user experience is buttery, it's quirky and fresh. What I find most magical about it is it says something without saying much at all, like the best technology. 

I think once people start seeing how fast, smooth and graceful an application [built on Node](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5122429) is, they won't want to go back. That excites me. The quirky fresh feel is why I've built this site on Node, and it's why I spend endless hours learning it, now with a tab open to the new Myspace, listening to Jay Z back to back with the Freelance Whales.

That says something, without having to say much at all.
