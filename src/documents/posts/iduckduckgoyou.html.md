This time last year I wrote a piece to the list.*

I wrote about the steps I take when a reader sends me an email. This was the nut graph: I Google you the first time I receive an email from you. I didn't expect the response I got. It was a wide range of responses, most of which boiled down to: how _dare_ you google me when I email you.

I went from bewildered to flabbergasted. Of course I google you! I write. You know more about me than I do you. So, I do a quick search to get a gut hit on who you are, what you do, and what we might have in common. I'm not doing an intensive background search to find your juvie records from the 90s, man.

Anyway, this is an update on that piece. I don't google you anymore. Now I duck duck go you. 

I Duck Duck Go You
------------------

In my experience, as of February 2013, Duck Duck Go is in all ways superior to Google. I deleted my Google account at the end of 2012 and haven't missed it at all. (Yes, that means I gave up my six year old email address, and calendar, and all things G. And no. I don't miss any of it.)

When I duck duck go you, I get different results than you get if you're Googling yourself. Google, from what I experienced, reflects the results you the user most want to see. It's called a filter bubble. 

Duck Duck Go doesn't [filter bubble me](http://dontbubble.us/). I like that.

So this is just an update on last year's inbox piece. No, I don't google you anymore. 

Now, I duck duck go you.

Trends
------

An overall trend that I'm seeing is lots of old stuff from people. Like that flavors.me or about.me profile you created on a whim in 2010, is now in your second or third search result. If you don't want me or anyone else clicking that, and taking it as your latest self, you might consider deleting that profile. 

Now, I know with web 2.0 services always provided a delete button. And now, the trend is for companies to not even put a delete button on the profile page. In my experience, if you email a founder or community person, they'll hand-delete the profile for you.

Nothing beats having your own site. That's what I'm always looking for. I'll scroll to the end of the first page of results looking for a personal site before clicking on a generic flavors or tumblr or about profile. 

I don't have a profile on the major social networks, so if you're behind a login wall, I will never see anything you're working on, ever. I think this should go without saying, but somehow it doesn't.
