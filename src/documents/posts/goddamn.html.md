Goddamn this is hard to write.

I have put it off, and put it off writing it. That's because it's hard to write. And writers don't get to write the easy shit, we don't get off the hook because we learned some things and now we know better. 

We write what we know, and what we thought we knew, and how we learned to reconcile ourselves to our shittiness.

Anyway, that's what the writer you're reading writes.

I'm trying to become a programmer right now, but my heart is a writer, and always and always a writer.

Don't read it if you have some precious idea of yourself of me that you'd like to protect.

I'm in my grandmother's basement. At the end of 2012 I ran so completely out of money I had the choice to spend another night homeless, or fly back to her place in Carolina. She and my grandfather have helped me out of so many pickles, including total abandonment by my father age zero, that I didn't feel right coming back. Burden, and all that. But I saw I was kind of more of a burden by not coming back. So, here I am.

I'm sitting in a bright yellow fold up chair that my ex-boyfriend who was ten years older than me gave me. He got it, maybe stole it, out of the back of the skate shop we met at. 

I have not drunk a drop of anything, and still I'm telling you the truth about my little unraveling, since anyone who talks to me asks where the hell I've been and I always freeze like this little frog I saw in the yard the other day. He or she might have been a toad, but he looked like a he...frog.

Anyway. 

I stopped publishing to the public web at the height of everything I was doing, everything my career, if you can call a hodgepodge of all I loved and nothing I didn't, was.

That was two years ago. Two years ago this April. 

I was in love with two men at the same, and they both knew it. And they both loved me back, and I think in a way they loved each other, too. Love and hate at the same time, maybe.

Anyway, this is no story of star-crossed lovers. 

This is he loved me, and I loved him. And he loved me, and I loved him. They never slept with each other. But I slept with each of them, with the other aware of the fact. This isn't a story of backstabbing and lies. This is a story of hard work, and edge dwelling and nails bleeding not literally but figuratively as I figured out how to balance things.

I did not. Balance them, that is.

They sort of self corrected when the police showed up. We were four months on, the three of us, at that point.

But, that's the next chapter in the story.

For now, there's this. And, [Hex](/pages/hex). Which is this sort of young adult fiction piece I am writing. Maybe it's terrible and you'll hate it. If there's any good in it, it goes to Holly Root who signed me, And Molly O'Neill who said, "hey, have you ever though about young adult fiction?" And I was all, "oh, hell no. ...But...maybe?"

Maybe you can't believe I'd be so direct about things. I don't care. I am not writing this so you'll share it with five hundred of your closest.

I am writing it because I know you know there's truth in it.
And, I know you know that's all I can tell you, now that the telling's begun.

The frog died the very next day, by the way.
