Today marks 31 days in a row I've made at least one commit to git, and pushed it to Github, and then live to my site. 

Insights
--------

+ I think [modularly](https://npmjs.org/)
+ I follow [strong developers](http://component.io/)
+ I only began recognzing strong developers by being in code each day
+ As with yoga, a little each day is better than nothing and then tons
+ [Git Aliases!](http://tjholowaychuk.com/post/26904939933/git-extras-introduction-screencast)
+ Deploying trumps talking about deploying. Deployed: this site, [chat.gwenbell.com](http://chat.gwenbell.com/) and [subway.gwenbell.com](http://subway.gwenbell.com/)
+ Deploying leads to self-reliance
+ I can both be a [writer and a hacker](http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html)
+ When not hacking, I [dance](https://new.myspace.com/gwenbell) or stretch or nap or read
+ Be. Constantly. Tweaking.
+ Learn the [command line](http://gwenbell.com/posts/lifeonthecommandline) by moving over to Linux 
+ I'm back on Mac OS X after 6 months on Ubuntu - nice to be back, but I'd rather be Linux full-time eventually
+ I wish everything could be git committed. Git has changed my life.

Now that my site is where I want it, I'm going to start thinking about what to do in my next 31 days of commits. Hmm...
