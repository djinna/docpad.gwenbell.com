I moved to Brooklyn today. I mean, the flight took off finally at 3 in the morning. There was a delay from 8p to midnight. Then from midnight to 2a. Then there was a medical emergency on the incoming flight. And then, the plane took off. Got into Brooklyn around five this morning. So I'm tuckered, but I'm wired. You know that feeling?

Anyway, one of the first conversations after getting in went like this, "what are you most excited about right now and why?" I'm like: I learned the terminal, I switched over to Linux and went into the machine - I mastered this machine. But the thing that is shaking the foundation is Bitcoin. That changes everything.

Why? That's the harder question to answer. Two nights ago (I think, I lose track of when what happened while traveling) there was a fork in the blockchain. The blockchain, as best explained to me by Mike Hearn, someone who works on the dev team for Bitcoin, works like this. Each transaction, from the very first, is accounted for on the blockchain. Each new transaction acts like a lego, stacking on the one before it. So the very first transaction, from Satoshi Nakamoto, was the genesis block. That's just what it was called. And you can see it for yourself.

Anyway, the other day, two days ago, there was a fork in the blockchain. The blockchain works like a merkle tree. (See, this is getting a little more complex, isn't it?) Anyway, the fork had a bug in it and people (the miners) needed to stop allowing transactions through - else there might have been double-spending. 

The developer team put out an emergency call to get people to stop transacting on one part of the fork, and to accept the other fork as the official branch.

Anyway, I know this is a lot to take in if you're not a Bitcoiner, so I'll just leave it here. The developer community, and the miners, handled it like masters. It was amazing to witness.

The blockchain matters because it's a public ledger of all the transactions that have ever happened in the world of bitcoin. That matters, because nothing can 'go missing' or 'arrive out of nowhere'. It's a record, in the same way git records every transaction on a site.

Are you getting it?
