Went to [Outlier](http://outlier.cc/) today. I've been wearing their daily riding pants for a solid year. It's a product I [recommend often](http://gwenbell.com/pages/belongings). I went to thank Abe to his face. Then I asked about a hundred questions, including 'what product totally flopped?', 'when will you be making more ladies clothes', 'what did you think of that dress vid I sent you from Singapore?', 'do you speak at events pretty often?', 'did you ever have a physical product before your first pair of outlier pants?', etc. He was gracious in answering each one. This is Abe, in his element.
