I started with a clean install of Ubuntu today. Here's what I start with from a clean install. 

This tutorial is for you you're new to Linux and want to get up and running fast, or if you just enjoy looking over other people's shoulders to see how they organize their digital environments to work.

+ Before I did anything else, I installed [RedNotebook](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rednotebook) and wrote for half an hour while I drank cinnamon coffee.

+ I installed [Byobu](https://launchpad.net/byobu). In the creator's own words: Byobu is an elegant enhancement of the otherwise functional, plain, practical GNU Screen

+ I installed git 

+ I installed Sublime Text 2 [this tutorial helps](http://www.technoreply.com/how-to-install-sublime-text-2-on-ubuntu-12-04-unity/). You'll be on the command line.

+ I tweaked all my settings for my desktop and browser. That included switching the default search bar to [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com).

+ I changed my desktop background image to a [Subtle Pattern](http://bradjasper.com/subtle-patterns-bookmarklet/). (Wild Oliva if you're hunting for it.)

+ I installed [Shutter](http://shutter-project.org/downloads/) for screen shots

+ I cloned into [my DocPad repository](https://github.com/gwenbell/docpad.gwenbell.com)

+ I started writing this piece, and will publish it to DocPad posthaste

Here's what my desktop looks like as I finish this piece (I usually fullscreen Sublime when I'm writing):

+ After I took that photo I installed [DocPad's Node.js dependencies](http://docpad.org/docs/install).

Now I'm going to run DocPad, take a look at the live rendering of this piece, fix any errors and push publish. If you're subscribed, you'll see it instantly.

If this helps you, please consider donating Bitcoins. Thanks to Coinbase, sending and receiving them is a pleasurable act.
