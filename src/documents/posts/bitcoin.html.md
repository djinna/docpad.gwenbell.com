Bitcoin clicked for me in Japan.

A Japanese hippie came into the tent, and he talked to the other Japanese hippie who was polishing a wooden ball with a spoon. 

I've never really seen Japanese people sit around, smelling like patchouli, drinking rum chai. But here we were, and what if, I thought. What if instead of thinking about the conversion rate from the dollar to the yen, what if I could just pay these hippies in a universal denomination: bitcoin. 

This is what I wrote into my notebook that day:

<blockquote>In a tent in Japan. It's not something I ever thought I'd say. 3 July. 2012. Walked to Ginkakuji. Just ordered a rum chai. We're fully internationalized. I remember when you couldn't even find chai in Japan, let alone drink it with sleepy hippies in a yurt.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Maybe the hippies had it right all along and we're all just catching up to them. Bitcoin will replace paper and coin. Energy exchanges will be a better match.</blockquote>

By the end of my entry that rum was starting to warm up my insides. I have no idea what I mean in the last sentence. But I do think it'll be amazing if the next time I'm in Japan, I can pay those hippies in their tent with their misshapen gourds...in BTC.

When I started accepting donations in Bitcoin, the price for one bitcoin was $11. 

Today it's at $27.

If I'd paid those hippies in bitcoin instead of yen that day, their btc would be worth more than double today than it was then. 

Yen, [not so much](http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2006-05-11/easing-out-of-quantitative-easing).
