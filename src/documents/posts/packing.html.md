Today's [commits](https://github.com/gwenbell): Update header. Update head shot. Add Git tab. Add Buy tab. Add this piece. Add socialnode.go to terminal to watch updates (thanks inhies!).

Heading to NYC, which means I'm packing down. Each time I leave a place I pack down to one bag. I look at each object that goes into the bag and ask, "what is this? Why is it coming with me? Why not delete it?"

I do the same with this site each day. I ask, "what is that doing here? Should it be elsewhere? Why not delete it?" It's amazing what can accumulate in just a few days.

I'm hearing from all sorts of you either on the go, or in NYC.

I'm feeling _what wonders await_? 

Packed down, ready to deploy.
