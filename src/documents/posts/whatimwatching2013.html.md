There are four angles of tech I'm engaged with at the start of 2013. 

+ Open source, which [we're already seeing](http://github.com) [lots of](http://bitbucket.org/)

+ Crypto. People want to know that their communications that are supposed to be secure really are secure. To that end, check [Pond](https://github.com/agl/pond)

+ Peer to peer things like Bitcoin. I monitor [Preev](http://preev.com/) daily

+ Real-time web, like the [new Myspace](http://new.myspace.com). And that, too, will likely be replicated and distributed. Also, [DocPad](https://github.com/gwenbell/docpad.gwenbell.com).

Distributed web publishing platforms like [Media Goblin](http://mediagoblin.org/), small apps like [Subway](http://subway.gwenbell.com/) which you can deploy on your own servers. 

The more frustrated people get with single point of failure mega-sites, the more we'll see. This is where we're heading.
