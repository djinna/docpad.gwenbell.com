Conversation at the Hairdresser

*"You've just got the shiniest hair!"*

*"I use Bronners on it."*

*"Well, what is Bronners?"*

*"Bronners peppermint castille soap. Oh god, this is turning confessional. It's soap, but more than soap. Magic soap."*

*"Oh, honey! You can't use soap on your hair. How is it your hair looks so good when you wash it with soap?"*

*"I wash everything with Bronners. Only beauty product you need!"*

That happened today. As I sat in the chair I remembered the one time when I asked for a perm, and my grandmother took me in to get one. My hair didn't take it, the perm just fell out. So I had to go in for a second one. I also remembered the time I went away for church camp and when my grandmother picked me up she saw I'd dyed my hair L'Oreal Pumpkin Spice or somesuch. And the orange (it wasn't really auburn as I'd hoped for) had grown out, and my roots were showing. Last time I dyed my hair.

It's bittersweet, I'm wrapping up this time I've been spending with my grandparents. Mostly my grandmother, because she's exactly the same as she was when I lived with her. Apparently boundless energy, a billion projects, and she plays solitaire at night, I reckon because she has a lot of energy left over she'd otherwise use vacuuming or reading or knitting. Or, idk, raising llamas.

My grandfather watches either MASH or Jeopardy and when I ask what he's up to he says, 'you're lookin' at it' and waves at his light blue La-Z-Boy chair.

Three days until wheels down in New York City. This'll be my first time living in the city. When people in my life ask how long I'll be there I say, 'foreverish' because I think that's true. (That said, nomad.)

I spent 2012 all over the globe. Doing so made me wonder if the globe doesn't all bend in towards NYC. Nearly every person I talked to asked where in the States I was from. And when I didn't say, "New York City" they asked well, had I been there, and how is it really, and then they'd say they want to see it for themselves.

Tonight I watched Ghostbusters for the first time. My mom never let me watch it, said it'd give me nightmares. I see now why. Still. Solid prep movie for NYC relocation. A reminder that good signage can really turn a business around. 

Also, that sometimes people become possessed by evil spirits. I'll be on the lookout.
