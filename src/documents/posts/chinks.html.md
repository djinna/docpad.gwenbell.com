Last night I chatted. I don't do that too often, because I'm usually in the work. So it was good to just sit there and listen for a lot of it, share stories for part of it, and wonder the whole way through.

What thrilled me most were the honest non-guarded answers I got to some of the questions I asked. I asked questions like: how do you know when someone you've been reading for years goes from signal to noise? 

And when that person you just mentioned, when she went from small potatoes to the cover of a magazine and scoring Dolce and Gabbana outfits, why did you go from loving to hating? Or is it a shade of something else?

And when you use the word 'friend' what are you really saying? When you refer to this missing piece of your world, what would it be like to drop that label and laugh with the people you're in the room with?

It's not the storylines that interest me anymore. It's the chinks in the storyline.
