I was up until 2 yesterday. Chatting. In [chat.gwenbell.com](http://chat.gwenbell.com).

Delight! To be in a room with a group of people, some of whom didn't know each other, all of whom were in different parts of the world. 

And to know the room was hosted on my own server.

How it Works
------------

Chat.gwenbell.com is an instance of [hij1nx's node chat server](https://github.com/hij1nx/node-chat). What that means is if you want one, too, you can clone it down from hij1nx. I've done very little customization to it so far. The instructions are enough to get you going with it.

Extending it
------------

Couple of things I want to have it do but it doesn't yet.

+ No database (therefore if you leave me a message, I won't get it) (might keep it this way, as it frees us up to chat with no log of the talk)
+ No notifications (therefore I don't know if someone said something while I was afk)

It worked. It let a group of us talk, on our own terms. There's something in that.
