I came to North Carolina at the end of 2012. I'm leaving tomorrow, March 12, for New York. Here's what I learned in Carolina.

I learned how to do anything I want with my machine, on the command line.

I learned how to use, and love, Linux.

I learned to program, starting with a refresher from Codecademy, and working my way up to JavaScript and Node.
 
I'm on a 40+ day streak on github at the moment. Though I prefer gitboria (which you can only access through CJDNS - it's in hyperboria) I use github on a daily basis now.

I learned Node.js.

I learned to deploy Node apps (see chat.gwenbell.com and subway.gwenbell.com, as well as this site itself). 
I mastered Bootstrap.

I learned how to do a proper sit up. Turns out I'd been doing it wrong all these years, putting too much effort in in my hips.

I learned some Go, and I launched the socialno.de Go reader, which delights me.

I learned to use git not just for committing the front and back ends for gwenbell.com, but to do pull requests on open source projects on github.

I learned about China by reading A Chinese Life. And it turns out, I enjoy reading graphic novels.

I learned I love WebRTC and much prefer it over Skype.

I spent hours in IRC and discovered I love, and respect, the Node and real-time web crowd. #stackvm if you don't already frequent it.

I learned I love Six Feet Under, by watching every single episode back to back.

I learned I also love Dexter. By watching every single episode back to back. Except the last few episodes, which annoyed me.

I learned the proper way to make seven layer cookies.

I learned to enjoy the stillness of quiet nights in the countryside.
