I've never done something just so it will look good on my resume. I can't imagine living like that, and I hope you can't either. Maybe you won't have to think about resumes ever again if I get my wish: to have git replace resumes once and for all.

**Git as a Resume Replacement**

When I first started learning [git](http://git-scm.com/) I resisted it. Why track each change I make to a project? The reasons were clear - speed, efficiency, organization - but my will was low. I'd learned FTP and thought that was good enough. 

As I wrote about in Digital Warriorship, it was Linus Torvalds, the creator of git, that pushed me over the edge. I decided to dive in, and I was sloppy at first. I'd forget to stage changes and when I did, I'd commit with a hasty, 'made a dozen changes'.

For a one-person team that's ok. However, get another person on the project making changes, it's a problem.

I stuck with my commits. In time, I got faster, stronger and more consistent. Right now I'm on a [nine-day commit streak](https://github.com/gwenbell) knock on wood. 

Git matters because it shows what you're working on now, how you're working on it and how often you publish. In short, it shows how committed you are. 

Git is best suited for those who code. Those of you who don't code, you can get a Github account and think of novel ways to use git to illustrate your work ethic. 

**Benefits to Git**

Like the [blockchain](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain), it's difficult to forge. It's based on hashes, cryptography, which I think is something we'll see more of in the future. (It's also something I'm personally fascinated by.) It's a public record (and you can pay for an account to keep it private) of your work ethic.

We're in a [post-jobs economy](http://www.rushkoff.com/blog/2011/9/7/cnncom-are-jobs-obsolete.html); your current work ethic is all that matters.

**Why Resumes are Borked**

+ Resumes are game-able
+ Resumes focus on the wrong things, like length of time on the job
+ Resumes don't highlight your current skill set

**Other Resume Replacements**

+ Life list: do, doing, done. I've created a list of experiences in three parts: done, doing and to do. Incidentally, years after I first published about life lists, it's _still_ one the pieces I get the most emails about. These kinds of lists give more insight into who you are than a resume ever could.
+ Belongings. If I know what you own, I know what owns you. Some of the world's greatest leaders lived with least. When I catalog my belongings, I give you insight into my priorities. In my experience, people remember and follow up about your belongings. I met a reader in Berlin in July 2012 - he thanked me for recommending Sonicare in my belongings list. 

We live in a post-job world, so we also live in a post-resume world. These are some ways to start replacing the outmoded with the new. I'm sure I'm missing some ideas. What do you use as a resume replacement? 

You can start your git commit log with a [pull request](https://github.com/gwenbell/docpad.gwenbell.com/pulls) if you'd like to share your idea.
