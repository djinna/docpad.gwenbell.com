I've never done something just so it will look good on my resume. I can't imagine living like that, and I hope you can't either.

**Git as a Resume Replacement**

When I first started learning [git](http://git-scm.com/) I resisted it. Why track each change I make to this site? The reasons were clear (speed, efficiency, organization), but my will was low. I was sloppy at first. I'd forget to stage changes and when I did, I'd commit with a hasty, 'made a dozen changes'.

For a one-person team that's ok. However, get another person on the project making changes, it's a problem.

I stuck with my commits. In time, I got faster, stronger and more consistent. Right now I'm on a [nine-day commit streak](https://github.com/gwenbell) knock on wood. 

If a resume is required, your git commit log is one of the best logs anyone could ask for. Why?

Git shows what you're working on now, how you're working on it and how often you publish. In short, it shows how committed you are. 

We're in a [post-jobs economy](http://www.rushkoff.com/blog/2011/9/7/cnncom-are-jobs-obsolete.html) but I still see and hear the old vernacular. I see companies pitching jobs based on the old job:vacation time ratio model. 

Nobody says they're hiring for life, but the most self-important tech companies boast ping pong tables and espresso machines. And they're still asking for resumes like it's 1950.

**Why Resumes are Borked**

+ Resumes are game-able
+ Resumes focus on the wrong things, like length of time on the job
+ Resumes don't highlight your current skill set

**Resume Replacements**

+ Git commits as resume replacement. Those of you who don't code, get a Github account and think of novel ways to use git to illustrate your work ethic.
+ Life list: do, doing, done. I've created a list of experiences in three parts: done, doing and to do. Incidentally, years after I first published about life lists, it's _still_ one the pieces I get the most emails about. These kinds of lists give more insight into who you are than a resume ever could.
+ Belongings. If I know what you own, I know what owns you. Some of the world's greatest leaders lived with least. When I catalog my belongings, I give you insight into my priorities. In my experience, people remember and follow up about your belongings. I met a reader in Berlin in July 2012 - he thanked me for recommending Sonicare in my belongings list. 

We live in a post-job world, so we also live in a post-resume world. These are some ways to start replacing the outmoded with the new. I'm sure I'm missing some ideas. What do you use as a resume replacement? 

You can start your git commit log with a [pull request](https://github.com/gwenbell/docpad.gwenbell.com/pulls) if you'd like to share your idea.
