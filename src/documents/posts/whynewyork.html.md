Lot of people are asking: why are you moving to New York? Here's what I've got, unfiltered. 

New York fascinates me. Each time I bring up the face of someone I know who lives in NYC I connect with the work they're doing. That's important to me because I work seven days a week, and I don't like holidays because everyone stops doing whatever they're doing 9-6 or whatever, and I'm suddenly reminded: it's a holiday. Let's get back to work! 

I'm going to New York because it's maybe the most dynamic place I've ever been.

I'm moving to New York because I've never lived there.

I'm moving to New York because I know I'll be challenged.

I'm moving to New York because I don't even have to have a visa to live there!

I'm moving to New York because I know it will shape me, and expand how I think about things.

I'm moving to New York because some of the most amazing writers, developers, designers, architects, entrepreneurs and rock stars have lived, are living, some or all of their lives in New York.

I'm going to New York because Joan Didion is there at least some of the time, and I believe she's a literary giant.

I'm moving to New York because if there was ever a time to be there, it is now. Why? Because the future is happening, and I know if there's any place that's ready for it, it's New York.
