It's midnight. Brooklyn first impressions. People are so beautiful. Even wind blown people. I had an interview today in DUMBO. First interview in maybe ever. Well, there was that one time before I moved to Japan to teach English. Discovered it's super hard to summarize my skills. I do so many things. I write. I program. I travel. I speak different languages. I start businesses, I grow businesses, I close businesses. I regenerate every 6 months or so. So when I was asked how my resume would read, I couldn't give an answer. I just do what needs to be done every single day. Right now the thing that needs to be done is programming. More commits. And what's right in front of my face is yesterday chat.gwenbell.com broke because Node got updated from v0.8.16 to v0.10.0 so I need to fix chat. I have to keep stripping coffeescript out of the real-time site template I'm using. I want a PMD. And a few people at Superfine not only knew what Bitcoin was, one guy offered to pay me in them. Brooklyn gets it. DUMBO gets it. But yeah, you can't see my resume. Well, you can. Go to github.
