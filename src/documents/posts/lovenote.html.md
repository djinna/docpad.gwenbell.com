Well, Nunu. I feel sad. 

I'm writing this to thank you for loving me since before I was even born. And for always believing in me, even when I would say the most outrageous things. Like, "I want to learn how to tap dance!" and then you found Eddie and I started wearing sequined leotards and tap shoes. 

And this most recent time, when I came to stay in your basement. And I said "I'm going to become a programmer!" what you said was "well, alright honey. What kind of books do you need?" And I just appreciate that chutzpah, that willingness to support me transforming myself year after year. And even today when you dropped me at the airport, you said "well, good luck on the next phase of your life! And I still hope you come visit sometime." 

I don't want to wait until you're senile or dead to tell you how much you matter to me.
