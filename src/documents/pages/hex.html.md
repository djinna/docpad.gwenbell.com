Anika escaped.

She's standing at the edge. It's ten hours after her mom died, and the chain started. The chain only happens once every 280 years and it's the trigger that starts the same battle that started 280 years earlier. This time, Anika wants to change the outcome. If she can make th samskara leap, history will change. But everything, starting with her mom's death, has to happen just so.

*

She reaches into her pocket to finger the three stones. The turquoise one is cool and pulsates at heart rate. The purple is warm and the fuzziness makes her half-smile. The dark green one, a little squishy, moves out of her grasp. As usual.

All signs point to go but first her mom has to trigger the chain. It could happen tonight or tomorrow and she's impatient. Not thtat she wants her mom to die, hardly. But without her deat, nothing that has to happen can.

Her vitals indicate she's ready, and when she hears the llamdragon she knows. Time. Not for the chain but for dinner. She sighs and looks out the window at the grey. That it always is, just beyond barely perceptile greens that it always is.

The building is grey, concrete hexagons stacked on top of each other. Ostensibly the same thing happening in each one, but Anika wouldn't know. The terrace is hexed, all hexes. There's no escape, except through death. Or for the battle of 280 to be fought again, and this time won. Not won so much as jumped.

Anika touches the tips of her fingers together igniting the kairos function. "If I have to sit through another dinner, at least I'll have my extensions."

She enters the hex. A tray slips out of the wall. On top of the tray, a stack of thin aluminum hexes, each like the other, except a different scene on top. Anika takes her stack and sits on the floater. She hovers a few feet above ground, and frisbee-like flings divvies out the disks in front of her.

The table doesn't exist in full until all guests present and distribute their own hex disks. Once everyone is present, the game begins. Every night, the same meal but less of this to you if you lose, more of this to you if you win. Tonight she wants dessert but more wants sleep (or Rest. There is no sleep here. You slip into sleep you're in game again. Rest is the space between sleep and dream).

"Pass the green," Anika's cousin Lex says. Her mom clears her throat, slides a glowing purple hex in front of her, docking two points from Lex. Lex'd forgotten his/her turn order. Must be tired. 

Anika's mom clears her throat a second time. The speaking token pulsates in front of her. Her skin transulcent, her heart beating faster than usual. Anika stares at her green, her grandmother to her left, cousin Lex to her right. Uncle across the table and grandfather next to him. The five of them listen. The hexes shift to illuminate the speaker. Phlegm and then, "My time is soon. I don't know when but I've received my final paperwork."

Nobody moves except Anika.

"Why don't you just end it already. Get this over with."

From under the table, a pinch. Anika jerks away, in time for her turquoise to go cold.

"That is not the order of things. We go when we're summoned. Too soon, 280 repeats."

Her mom tried to keep her color and calm; that was the game. Inside she seethed though, and as her roots glowed, betraying her and docking her an automatic ten. 

Looks like cousin gets dessert this round. Anika is off for Rest. Everyone else exits after recompiling.

**

"She's just eleven, Aleph. She doesn't get the complexity yet. She hasn't met Tensegrity - and until she does..." 

The two - Aleph and her daughter Lenovox (Len) are floating in a pool of water. They're floating on lily pads playing a simple pond game - you feed the koi hex-shaped disks and the frogs jump from pad to pad. Mom and daughter, relaxing the way it was when Len was younger, Anika's age. 

"Remember when we played this when you were little and the frogs would get so fat on lotus buds they'd burst?"

Len laughed, her teeth straight and gleaming in the dusk. Then she stopped. A lump arose from her belly to her throat. Her mom noticed, "Nausea?" "yes." "I'll get the expeller." Together the two helped the lump from Len's body. Another glowing orb, gone. Those orbs were the life force, and they were leaving at a faster clip.

The two shifted colors, from translucent opular to slate grey. The koi gathered beneath them, swishing their tails. It began to rain on the pond, fat drops that sent the koi in ten directions, back to their bases at all six corners, to rest for the night. It would be a long one, Aleph knew.

"I'll turn up the canisters."
"No, don't. I don't want to increase my dependency."
"It won't..." Aleph started. Then stopped.
"Won't what," But it was too late. Her true intention came up through the rain, breaking the pond's surface, an orange and white striped koi, with a tiny hex in its mouth. A note.
Len reached down for it, Aleph unable to stop her since she was more than two away.
"She's weak but not dead," she thought. Squeezing a thought in while the other emerged, the only safe play in the game.

On the miniateure screen before the two, "It won't make any difference now," Len said aloud - reading her mother's thoughts off the screen. Aleph's shoulders dropped, her grey eyes filled with tears, "You weren't supposed to see that."

Of course she wasn't but that's the game. This game.

The two closed their eyes, the koi pond and lotuses evaporate. They were alone in a desert.

"There is still something you have to untether from, as we both know. You can't depart with a secret."

"Right. Tomorrow?"

"It's always tomorrow. You're stalling."

"I need Rest."

*

Earlier that day Anika'd gotten her Keyhole tech. (Finally.) She overheard this entire exchange. Cryptohashes kept her from catching all but every tenth word. Still it was enough to confirm both her gut hits: one her mom had a short while left before crossing over. Two, she had an undone task. A secret that kept her from transitioning. But what was it? And why had she put it off this long?

And finally, who was Tensegrity?

*

There's no privacy in a hex. Especially if you're under 16. All sides end in corners. Six sides, six corners, six beings, no privacy.

Lex, two years Anika's senior, sat in the adjacent hex playing the newest release of Mine - a game that requires you to move deeper into a mine without losing track of where you'd been before. The two - Lex and Anika - were thinking almost identical thoughts largely because they were in adjacent hexes and couldn't stop it. How do I get out of here? they co-thought. Why is each day the same even though I can project anything I wanto onto the wall, onto any surface?

The Ultimate in Freedom the brochure had said. It was written on a glass hex, and it had arrived in the mail just months earlier. If Lex's dad - also his mom - Davux had been a little more adventuresome, a little more firm in his commitments the two would still be in Canrah, though their needs might not be as well met. Who cares? Who wants to trade freedom for comfort?!

He forgot where he was in the mine, and reset.

Canrah and its inhabitants are gender-fluid, so Lex and her mom, also his dad, Davux was also her and her mom. Sing replicators, they'd escaped one trap - the cycle of needing another - opposite input to reproduce. 

But Canrah had been wracked in recent years with server floods and grid wrecks. Davux had grown weary and retunred to Hex - trading freedom and the daily deluge for a full-time lock-in. Lex thought it absurd, but was too young to change the situation. Other than to plot as she suspected (knew) Anika was: a hex-scape. But to where? And how? And really why? He didn't get what Anika's plan was, or why she was so determined but he was on board. 

Maybe.

*

"All of life is a game, and you are the player, and the played." So began each day in Hex. The message comes from the center - the center of the Wildeverse. It was the same message daily - a reminder of the Chinese fingerlock of living in Hex.

You're in it, and you are it. If you want out, you have to die for it. If you stay in, you live. Unless you have a bend, the way Anika's mom (Aleph's daughter) did. It's an epigenetic mutation that gives its bearer a double-edged sword. Unprecedented foresight, on a deadline.

Meaning, you have to die to get the foresight.

Each insight, you die a little.

The Wildeverse's Eight Card. Prescience with a price. Foresight you have to die for. 

That's why when Anika suggests her mom dies faster, what she's asking for is a window to the future she doesn't have access to but her mom does. She wants to know what's going to happen next. 

*

Anika draws the shape of her zabuton with her forefingers. She notices how dirty her fingernails are, probably from the earlier game with Lex. She doesn't care, she needs Rest. She squishes the sides together, noticing the weight of the kapok in her hands. She takes the three stones from her pocket, and passes one to the other with three thoughts: focus, play, release.

Repeat. From right hand to left. Focus, play, release.

Her mantra. These are the three things she uses to prepare for the battle ahead. If she's to be a warrior, she thinks - or Lex thinks - or perhaps someone walking outside the thin paper door that separates her from the center thinks - she has to be focused. She can't waiver from the task at hand, whatever it is that day. She has to maintain her tranquility at all times, no matter what's happening on any layer of the board. 

Focus, play and release. That order. Once your hand is off the piece, turn's over.

No mulligans.

**CHAPTER TWO**

**The Samskara Jump**

What's samskara? And why do you want to jump it?

To understand samskara is to grasp the whole wildeverse. What it's stuck in, what it is that's stuck, and why.

As you'll see, why is less answerable, so let's start with what.

When you go to the dentist and she asks if you're flossing daily and you say yes but really mean no, what she's talking about is the spaces between your teeth. She wants to know if you're clearing the space between. She wants to know if you're getting into the grooves where the enamal meet the gums. 

Samskara is the grooves in the wildeverse. Samskara is actually the one big groove that everyone looks at but nobody knows what to do about. The other thing about this groove is it's a shape shifter. The groove reflects the same ethos, but it's not always in the same place.

The final thing about this groove, the reason it reappears every 280 years to conquer, but so far nobody's succeeded at conquering is this: samskara is like your thumbprint. It's a unique reflection of you. And though it's ubiquitous, and impacts everyone, it's unique. 

To jump it, everyone has to be in on it, and everyone has to simultaneously be willing to jump the track.

The samskara jump would lead to a revolution, but each of us has to be on board. It's like we all decide to floss, collectively, all at once, our souls.

**

What Anika knows is this. Her mom has to die for next chance at the jump. 

What Anika also knows is this. Her mom can't die in vain. There has to be a reason for her death, and the reason is society has to make the jump. 

**

She looks in the mirror, stretches her eyebrows and lightens her skin tone to a lighter blue. 

She gathers her three stones and decides on her day's Edges.

Each day she gets two Edges. These give her an advantage if she chooses well, and an Edge could be the loss or win of a game. But if she chooses poorly, she'll know within a few minutes of play. Each two years, the number of Edges she can choose from increases by five. So she now has fifty-five Edges, ranging from invisibility to stretchability. If she chooses well today she'll gain another Hexpoint, experience points tallied at the end of the day. When you collect enough you can buy new technologies, like the Keyhole Extenders. But if she loses, no big deal. Focus, play and release.

**Swords and Letters**

"Lex, I'm ready!"

"I'm not. I need some microvits to tip my hair," Lex responded from a few feet away.

Lex had recently taken to tipping his hair when he was playing the day's games as a guy. And lengthening it on days he was playing as a she. Today, tips it was.

"Let's start with Penang," Anika yelled back. One of her favorites, this one involved a gameboard the size of the whole room, floor to ceiling star shaped tiles, the color of a peacock's feathers. So it was as though you were inside a rainbow. There were several elements to play. One random, two memorization, one mnemonic and all of it pointed to learning several languages.

"I don't know," Lex walked in, "do you think this purple on white works?"

"I am not your stylist, Lex. Just finish getting ready," she thought-responded to him.

"I see what kind of gamer you'll be today," and he turned on his heel and left while adjusting his polka-dotted bow tie.

Anika pulled her striped tights up, adjusted her hair in the mirror one last time.

Let the game begin.

**

"Chigaou-yo!" Anika shouted, Lex's tousled hair - in the end it was purple and white - in his face.

"Don't tell me I'm wrong unless you have a plan to fix it!"

It was nearing the end of battle, and the two were losing badly. She'd forgotten several words, and he'd overextended from the start. She half wondered if his Edges had been tomfoolery and poor sportsmanship. (Not options, natch.)

A knock.

In an instant the colors fade from the room, the whole hex freezes.

"Douzo," a response from inside.

"Hey you two want lunch or what? We've been pinging you for an hour," Aleph says.

"Yeah, ok ok."

The two roll their eyes at each other as they return to the game.

"Let's end it, I don't care, just seppuku yourself."

"You first."

"Together."

The two throw themselves on their swords, "Death is the beginning!"

The warriors pack it up and head to the central hex for lunch. The usual rigamarole, including public mid-day scoreboards for the whole of Hex. It's clear they were better off sticking with the game to its end. Lex and Anika are badly behind, the toddlers closing in on them. Her edges hadn't helped her at all, then neither had Lex's.

**

During Rest she meditates at the window. Softening her gaze, she sees or thinks she sees the green on the horizon. Is it out there, or is she so intent on it being on there she imagines it into being? That's the thing about Hex. You don't know where fantasy ends and reality starts. Or, maybe you're in reality and out there is fantasy. 

Transmission from Lex: We need a planning session. Where. When.

Because they're meshed (within one hex of each other) they're pretty sure they can send messages like this without interference. But they can't be completely sure because if one of the elders happens to walk by, they'll perceive the message has been sent. Lex knows it's dangerous, but had just been staring out the window, wondering what was out there. And if they'd make it out this time.

Under the cover of night? Or setting out early enough in the morning? Capture isn't an option twice.

Before she has time to answer, another transmission comes in. This time it's Yake. Time for training.

**Push and Hold**

Yake wants to know what two Edges she chose today. She tells him: poison and healing. 

"That would seem to be a wise choice, but why choose poison in the first place? You can win any game without doing harm, Anika."

"Yes, but you never know what your opponent is packing," comes her half-hearted response.

"What if there's a way you can use poison without doing any harm to yourself or others," Yake counters.

He pushes and holds her. Celebrates her wins, helps her see her blind spots. They are in an infinite loop together, and where the infinity symbol crosses over itself, there is hold. At the blind spots at the fat part of the sideways eights, he pushes.

"As you go into this next set, see if you can find a way to use your Edge as an advantage, without doing any harm," he says, ending the transmission with a wink. Or maybe that was a grimace. With Yake, you never knew.

**

Going into evening games, Anika had an additional mission. She knew the importance of another mission. If she could pass, she might earn three Hexpoints instead of two. But what difference did it make anyway? What difference would a few XPs make when it was all futile? She'd heard her mom earlier that day. She was leaning on a stick, drawing lines on the floor, walking instead of Rest because she knew sleeping now, loss of consciousness of any sort might mean the actual end. Not just another segue into a deeper level of game, but an altogether new game. Or a game beyond a game.

If Anika was to make the samskara jump she'd have to practice it now, and she knew Yake's advice wasn't advice at all. It was a mission, disguised as advice.

There was nothing she could do but try.

Still, how do you take poison and turn it into something healthy? How do you use poison for good only? Not just her own good, but the good of the game? The good of all players? Is it possible to transform poison?

She holds the vial in her fingers. She'd already used her other Edge, so it was down to this.

And then she knew what she had to do.

**

Final game of the day. Instead of a usual high action, motion-dense game, she chose to grow an arboretum.

The game is to grow as many species, and keep them growing under the canopy, as long as possible. The room fills with all manner of rare flora and fauna, including a single quetzal, a deep blue bird formerly found in the rainforests of Old Costa Rica.

How to use this vial of poison?

What do plants do, but convert poison to energy.

She whispers to the bottle: you are carbon monoxide. As you fill the air, the plants breathe deeply. They take in your poison and release oxygen, allowing the animals here to thrive.

She'd done it.

And it wasn't even the final game of the day.

Three experience points. 

But something was awry. She heard the sound of metal and clay falling or being thrown and broken.

Moments before the Hexpoints are awarded, she hears a cry.

It is time for battle, and this time she knows it's not with anyone but herself. This is the final stage of preparation. These are the final hours before her mom dies. How can she best prepare?

Focus, and play.

And now, release.

**

She returns to the cushion, looking out the window again. The noise outside has died down, but she's not hungry. She stays in and passes her stones - one slow movement after another. Left hand to right. Left to right. Left to right. Then back. Right to left. Right to left. Right to left.

Compose transmission to Lex:

Tomorrow morning. Pre-game. Meet me in the South corner, you in yours, me in mine.

**

With that, Rest came easily. The day was over and the slate grey solid, set. She hears the sound of her uncle in the kitchen, making final tallies. If she hadn't pulled through on the third point, thanks to Yake, she'd have ended this day with the toddlers. He helped her pull through again this time. But would he always be there when she needed him? And would his advice always match her gut? And if not, what then?

**Trees**

She enters the forest and a pile of hexes appear at her feet. They're dark brown, the color of the ground and of the tree trunks. The top hex is golden, and glowing, so she bends over to pick it up. The forest smells like mulch, she notices an earth worm when she gets close to the earth.

Game instructions.

Exasperated Anika groans, "Another game. I thought I got out!" and the hex pulsates in her hand. 

280 minutes. Match hex to trunk.

That's it. No more information. She has just a few hours to get an entire set of hexes matched to their corresponding trees. No pattern indicators, no Edges. No indication of what the outcome will be if she succeeds or fails.

She walks up to the firest tree, runs her fingers along its trunk. This is her first time touching a tree and she's surprised by its texture - cold, not unyielding but definitely not welcoming. Now where do I put this hex? Then she notices, near the tree's midriff, a hex-shaped recess, as though someone had taken a precision knife and etched six perfect lines to form a hexagram.

She takes the first hex of the pile, slots it in. Nothing. Tries the next. Nothing. On the third try, the hex clicks in an glows momentarily. The tree seems to wake up, though it does nothing special. 

"Now how am I suppose to know when it's a match? Is this glow _it_?" 270 minutes to go.

Frustrated, she slumps to the tree's base and begins to cry. "Lex didn't make it out, I'm stuck out here and nobody even knows where I am! I'm totally going to die out here..." And in her despair, she notices something is happening to the tree. It, too, appears to be crying.

**Awaken**

Anika awakens from the dream. It's her worst nightmare, actually, and the reason she Rests instead of sleeps. To go into the game without knowing the paramaters. The reason hexes are so safe is you know there are clearly delineated rules. Every game has a beginning, middle and end. A hexizen's deepest fear is this: to know they're in game, but not know one element: the boundaries.

She gets up and walks to her wall, flicking her wrist and illuminating the room while simultaneously covering the wall in mirrors. She adjusts the colors of her irises, drops the curls from her hair and smooths in a darker black, eliminating all the red from yesterday. She pulls her journal up on the full-screen mirrors.

28 July 2214

Made it to the forest again. Still unclear what the mission is. Lex didn't make it out.

Lex! That's right. This morning's pre-game meeting. Anika disappears the mirrors and creates a connection with Lex.

"Hey. Sorry, slept."
"Zannen. Me, too."
"What did you game?"
"Oh, the usual. I went back to Canrah. Again. I didn't know what the game was. Again. Still it was dusk, and the sun set slowly behind the mountains and I could smell the night fog coming in. Everything just as I remember it."
"You know there is no memory, L."
"Sure there is. I remember what happened in Canrah, just as you remember your mom healthy."
"Hardly."
"You do. I see it sometimes at meals, your face gives you away."
"Then I'm not practicing hard enough."
"No, you're preparing for the transition."
"Anyway, what do we need to do to make the jump, Lex?"
"You know what we need to do. But the question is, are we going to be able to make all the preparations in time?"
"I don't know, it could happen tonight. Would you be ready?"
"Yeah. I'm ready."
"You're not ready, Lex. You didn't make it in game last night while I slept."
"You know sleep is just levels of deception. You can't trust anything you see in sleep. Maybe you need to Rest tonight instead."
"Hai hai."

She knew she was in bad a shape as Lex was. If she couldn't moderate her own functions - all the adults of Hex could Rest without sleep for years - how could she expect Lex to make it out?

**

One of the upshots to living in Hex is you never go to school. You self-learn through games. Anything that you can learn, there's a game to teach you. The only drawback is you're always in game, you never escape it. If you're to escape the game altogether, you have to get out of Hex. 

The myth says there's a forest just beyond the periphery of Hex. And beyond the forest is another Hex.

But Anika thinks that myth has been propogated to keep her in game. She thinks that beyond Hex is forest, and beyond forest is something altogether unknown and unknowable. To get there, she has to first create an escape hatch (which she's working on with Lex), second, be part of a diversion and third, be prepared.

Each game she plays now is one to prepare her for the unknown. Even though there's a live tally throughout Hex of the games that you've played that day, and your score and Hexpoints earned, you can still be sneaky about your motives.

In fact, keeping quiet about the order, kind and scope of your games is itself part of the game.

**

Where is Hex? You already know what surrounds it - possibly. 

But to better understand it, it helps to view it from a bigger perspective.

Hex is located on the flipside of a game table in a mountain town in North America.

It's a huge game table, and there are games played out there nightly - unbeknownst to the inhabitants of Hex.

What Anika doesn't know, but suspects, is if she escapes, the world she'll find in every way outsizes her.

**

"Haaaaya! Take that!" shouts Lex's dad from the garden box. 

He and Aleph are playing a swordfighting game in which you're flanked by an animal of your choosing (digi of course) and they join you in your attempt to slay your opponent. The catch is that while you're playing, tiny flying disks of every color imaginable are flying in, attempting to distract you from making a hit.

Confetti'd to Death.

Aleph's shoulder-length silver hair covers her entire face as she pulls her face mask down and doubles over to take a breath. "Crikey, you've gotten faster, Davux."

"It's all my 'lates training," Davux responded shaking it off. 

The pair laughed, and noticed they had onlookers.

"Hey what are you two doing here? It's a little early for foraging, isn't it?"

Foraging. Isn't that a word used to find food in the forest? Had they...

But before she could finish the thought she noticed something flying her way, a small package.

"Sticky buns!"

"Your favorite. Now eat up and get on with you, we have a match to wrap."

"Whose game?"

"Child you know the answer to that. You don't know whose game until the game is over."

She detested the word child, but knew there was truth in what her grandmother said. And the game wasn't even fully begun.

**

That night Len took a turn for the worse. Everyone was in her grandmother's room with her. Len lay at the foot of the bed, breathing slowly and deliberately. She'd played prone games that day. Each member of the family massaged one of her limbs with scentless lotion. A quiet vigil.

"I'm not dead yet, you know! Somebody turn on some racket," Len said to nobody in particular.

"Firecracker. Alright, let's have some music."

The group stood, each with their own thoughts, listening to the peaks and troughs of the music. Quiet, underwater submersion sounds and then lilting arcs. Huge waves that carried you to new heights, cliffs that simply dropped and left you standing there, naked and tender, eyes blinking against the bright lights of midday.

Nobody escaped that vigil without tears. Everyone knowing it was near, and that this was the signal. It all hinges on her death, and yet, how could we know for sure? If the jump doesn't happen, what difference will her death have made? A million things could go wrong, and her losing her hair. Her losing her life force. Her losing her ability to stand unassisted. Her ability to game vertically.

All for naught.

**

The next morning, Aleph comes in and finds Anika at Rest next to her zabuton.

"Anika, it's your mom," she starts.

"I already know," Anika responds.

Silently the two return to her grandmother's room where just hours before each had said their goodbye. There, her mom's body, unmoving, the life force gone from it.

The candles flicker, the orbs float above the body, ready to move onto their next life form.

"The canisters," Anika says to her grandmother or no one.

"I can't..."

Anika walks over, switches off the artificial life force.

She looks at her mother's body one final time, and the chain starts.

**

"How will I know? How can you know?"

"Because, I am your mother and mothers can't lie to their daughters."

"You told me you could see through walls. Now do you really think I believed that one for instance?"

"For instance yes. Because I can."

"But there was a secret, a final message. You were supposed to tell me."

"You are right. And that's why I haven't passed. You have a good memory, Anika. It's one of your strengths. That and your ability to poke around; each day is a new day to you."

"So what's the secret?"

"Sit down, I think you need to be seated to hear this."

"This can't be good."

"Anika, I have always told you that you are a fatherless daughter. That you have no dad, that I never really knew who he was. But that's not entirely true. I told you that to protect you. I kept thinking someday I'd tell you about him. That day never came. Until today."

"Why?! Why are you telling me this now? Is he alive? How could you have lied?"

"I have prescience, Anika. You know that. That's why I have to cross over right now. And you need to wait a few years before you make it your mission to find your father. Or, best of all, you never even look."

"Like that's going to happen."

"Hey, I know you don't want to hear what I'm telling you right now. But your father is a dangerous man. And that's only one of the reasons I want you to wait until you're older."

"What are the other reasons?"

"You will know when it's time. Now, Ani. I have to leave you. I love you to the ends of the wildeverse. Be sweet."

Anika puts her hands into prayer position at her forehead.

She witnesses her mother's departure, crying at the news, crying at her leaving, crying at the task ahead. Which just got a whole lot messier.

**

Why did she wait so long to tell me about  him? And why tell me just in time to die? Is this the thing that's going to keep us from making the jump? A distraction! Of course. Diversion. That's one element of most of the higher level strategy games: diversions. Things that throw you off course, that take your mind away from the present moment. And all Anika can think about is her father. Who is the man? What if he's not even alive anymore? What if he's outside Hex? What if she's not even _from_ Hex at all? Is that why she's tried so hard, so many years running, to get out? She looks at herself in the mirror: what does he look like? Am I like him? And if so, am I dangerous, too? Is that why I have been trapped here year over year?

Anika looks in the mirror. Because she can change her hair type and color, every feature on her face can be extended, color changed, morphed in a flick of a wrist. She uncaps a bottle and releases clouds into the air. "Who am I and...does it matter? I'd rather be dead. Why couldn't I have just died too?"

These thoughts send her into a deeper spiral, a darkness sinks into the room, as the clouds she'd just uncapped transition from light blue, cumulus to dark grey, and deepening into raven.

"I have to pull myself together. I'm not going to get another trigger."

She pulls her knee-high boots on, snapping to lace the purple laces up quick and tight. Her one-piece dress (that morphs into other items) fitted to her lean frame. Her one bag is already packed. She opens the door, says goodbye to the few belongings she has that she isn't coming back to - ever.

**

She gets out through the window. It was always that simple. She opens the window and leaves. The point was never to keep her in. 

The point was to always allow her choice - but never to encourage her to leave. 

Never tell her that her road to freedom was right in front of her, all this time. That was the leaving game.

**

On the day of her departure, time stands still. She doesn't have anything other than a bag and a plan to make it to the jump by the time 280 hits. Everything rests on that moment, but she's not sure where she has to get to to make the jump. She's not sure which direction is North, even. Or, wouldn't, except Lex showed her how to install a compass into her ankle right before her mom's death. The compass led her north, no matter if she was laying flat on her back or not. (Hopefully she wouldn't spend too much time on her back; she needed to make progress fast).

As she enters the woods she hears a familiar yell, "Anika. Yo! I'm here!" 

She turns around to see Lex, her feminine self, standing there with her bag. Ready to head into the trees.

"Dios mio, you made it."

"Don't ask how but we have to move fast. I think our projecteds won't last long. But today was the only day we were gonna get out, and get this far this fast.
"
"Who would have thought it was through the window all along. So simple. Anyway. That way's north."

Lex looks at her ankle and smiles. The two angle themselves left and head in that direction.

She looks at her embedded timeclock, it's glowing 15:42. Just a little time before sunset (six in the evening) and they'd be spending their first night in the forest. Thankfully they have a tent, but little else. 

"Let's just get in there. We'll find out where we need to go once we're in."

"Ani, this isn't like the games. We're not going to just get directions from a loudspeaker," Lex's voice sounded different outside.

"Are you scared, Lex?" 

"Well, since you ask..."

"I think I see somebody. Hurry. We've got to get moving before we get caught."

With that, they enter the forest. 

Unfortunately they don't know what we know. The danger in the forest is ten x what it was in Hex.

This forest doesn't even have a name, though it's still on the hex grid, nobody's been in here for years. And the last person who went in didn't come out.

**

"Did you hear that?"
"No. What is it?"

Lex and Ani are in the tent. They've got a small fire going and are sharing a bowl of blue before sleep. The tent was only designed for one, a bell shaped, light-weight canvas, but they didn't have the energy to unpack the second.

"I say we put out the fire..."

"If we do that, we'll freeze in here."

"Ok, what about the body heaters I brought?"

"You brought body heaters? Are you kidding? That's so much weight. No wonder you were exhausted."

"Honestly, I don't know what to do. I'll put out the fire though, and we can use our fireflies to keep the tent lit tonight."

"Ok."

Both were shaken, but determined. They knew the path ahead required Rest. Both were unsure if sleep were dangerous in the woods, so they didn't even risk it. They'd left all communication devices behind in Hex so they couldn't be tracked.

So it was just the two of them, and the night, and the fireflies glowing in the tent.

Lex stands watch first, peeking into the woods through a peep hole in the tent. The two have put a forcefield around the tent, just a subtle one so as not to attract any untoward approaches. But it's not a charmed field, it's just basic alarms. If someone wanted to attack, they could do so easily.

Once an hour they switch out. When one Rests on her zabuton, the other watches. 

On the changing of the guard they signal to each other, putting their forefingers above their heads to signal "intense" ... "in tents".

**

"I have zero idea which way to go, Lex. No idea. What do you reckon?"

The two made it through their first night in the forest. There were no visitors, only total stillness. Both suspect there's something amiss.

They unzip the tent and look down. At first sight, the light from the sun causes them to pull back, as does the large object at their feet. A visitor.

"A turtle!"

Neither had seen a turtle this large in any of their projections. And definitely none of this stature.

Written on its back are six lines. All of them straight, parallel to one another, across the horizon.

"Well, what is that supposed to mean?"

"I think it's a message. Maybe it's a game. Can you hear us turtle?"

The turtle says nothing, but walks slowly away, crunching in the pre-dawn dew.

They rub their eyes. "We don't have anything to guide the way but our intuition."

"Let's pack up and head out. I bet they're looking for us by now."

"Don't be so sure, Nika. I'm not sure they care that we've gone."

"Or, it could be that nobody wanted to do this job. Nobody wants to make the leap, so they'll let us make it for them."

Both of them have dark lids, neither having gotten enough Rest the night before.

"This is thankless work. We don't know where we're going, if we'll make it or even why it matters really!"

"Anika, now's not the time. You know that when you're in game you have to stay focused, and never show your vulnerabilities."

"Who will notice? We're not even in game right now, Lex! In case you didn't get the memo. We're in a forest, and there's nobody here except maybe an old turtle. And there are no rules and we don't have any idea what game we're playing right now."

Her voice edged up and up.

It did seem there was something in the forest with them, something beyond the turtle.

Suddenly, one of her pocket pebbles began to heat up. Fast.

"Youch!"

She reaches into her pocket to find her turquoise rock is heating up, to unbearable levels. She drops it to the ground, where it begins tunnelling.

"Holy..."

"Wow. I didnt' know they were animated!"

"Yeah, neither did I."

As the pebble tunnels, the cousins stand there agape.

"Where's it going?"

"Like I would know? Should we follow?"

The two watch as the rock whirls and whirls, creating a pattern on the ground - an opening large enough for each of them to climb through. 

"I think so. I think this is our first message. Well, Mister Turtle was the first - but I have no idea what six straight lines means..."

"What do we have to lose? We can either try to get to the end of the forest by going straight through. Or we can try to go under it. This seems reasonable...ish."

The two grab hands. Anika notices Lex's are clammy. Overnight she's morphed into a boy.

"Nothing ventured..."

"Nothing gleaned!"

The two jump in, feet first. The hot pebble just ahead of them, feet away.

**

You can win any game by knowing the game is played with yourself. You can win any game, knowing there is no game.

"So you got my message?"

The only way Anika knows what the groundhog is saying is the universal translation bubble next to its head.

"Wait. Are you a..."

"Prairie dog? Yes. I'm Dan. There are millions of us in this forest. What have you never met a prairie dog? Don't worry," Dan laughs, "we're not all named Dan. But yeah, I suppose we all looks basically like this to you guys."

"Never met a dog, let alone a prairie one. Was that your turtle up there?"

"Shape shifter. So. Yes, and no."

"Well, what were the six lines?"

"I should be the one asking you the questions. What are you doing in my tunnel? What brings you to the forest. I haven't seen anyone here in...years."

"What do we need to know that we don't already know? What's in the forest? Is the jump point nearby?"

The prairie dog places its long fingernailed fingers over its belly and chuckles, warmly but with an obvious edge.

"Maybe the two of you would like some chai?"

"What's chai?" the two say at once.

"Oh my. You haven't gotten far from the farm before have you? It's a spiced delight. Let me put some on the boil."

Suddenly, and without warning, the two are surrounded by the smell of cardamom, ginger, cloves and fresh cinnamon.

"Well, wow," says Lex when the prairie dog places two mugs of steaming chai in front of them.

"It's Steiner to you, but I'll take wow," laughs the prairie dog.

The three sit in his earthen cabin, drinking chai, each in their own thoughts.

*

Anika, belly full of chai, drops straight into sleep, skipping Rest.

"You've got to kill Lex."

The voice was clear, and it was unequivocal: her mom had given this command. 

Anika wakes up. Must have dropped into REM, so rare. Her lips are chapped, and she's thirsty.

"How can I kill my own cousin? I love Lex."

But the moment she thinks that thought she knows it's untrue. She and Lex had never been close. In fact, they've sort of been at each other's throats for...

Before she finishes the thought she hears a sound behind her. She turns, prepares to fight. "Just up for a late night snack," yawns Dan.

He's a different color at night than he is during the day (though they're deep in the earth, they have simulated sun down here). A darker brown, almost black. A light beam off the top of his head.

"Can you read my dreams?" Anika says, her voice timid and quiet, squinting against the light emitting from Dan's forehead.

"What do you mean? What did you dream? You haven't been sleeping that long."

"I was on top of a mound, a hill I guess. My cousin, Lex, who you met today. We played king of the hill. I haven't played that for years. But...though he was winning...I knew what I had to do."

"What did you have to do?"

"I heard a voice? Do you have some water? I need to replace my external pack."

Dan tosses her a baglet of water. She switches out the spent pack for a new one.

"It was my mom's voice..." and she looks off into the kitchen, not wanting to make eye contact with Dan.

"And she said...?" 

"I don't want to say, Dan."

"You know I can guess and I think it's probably a good time to tell you: I know where you're headed. And what you dream must come to pass. It's vital you do it, to make the leap."

Anika felt as though the breath had been knocked out of her. The ast time that had happened was during a game. Which game though? And who had played? And which...who had won it?

This is the first time Anika has experienced gaps in her memory.

Was it then? Was that the seed was planted? And how could she possibly kill someone? She'd never hurt anyone nor any creature actually.

And now she's being asked to kill someone? Not just someone but Lex? 

She is aghast.

Dan notices.

"I can't."

"You know how this works, Anika." Dan flickers, and his light goes out momentarily.

"You know how this works," he starts again, banging his head to jumpstart his lamp again. "Prepare, play and forget it. Leave it on the battlefield, you are becoming the warrior you're called to be. You'll know when it's time. And, I will venture, we're going to see it happen soon."

And then Lex walks in. Ashen.

"Hey, guys." She rubs her eyes in the light of Dan's headbeam.

"Are you guys talking about me?"

"We were, actually but I should probably prepare for sleep," Dan says, shuffling away. "I'll leave you two to talk."

"What about your snack," Anika says.

"Oh, that's right!"

He reaches out for the hoverater and slides a door open. Inside, a cooler with two full-size penguins, both wearing eye masks.

"Ahem!"

"Oh. Ugh. Huh. Chocolate almond fudge mocha walnut? As usual?"

"As usual."

The penguins take a scoop out of the canister nearest them. 

"Two? Three?"

"Three. And give these guys some too, hey?"

**


Before Lex and Anika set out the next morning, Anika asks what the timeline is like. Dan says, "let's take a look at the cartography. I'll show you some of the local highlights. If you take the tunnels, we'll guide you but there aren't stops along the way."

He lays the map on the earthen table. The edges crinkle.

"Ok you guys want to get to Leap, right?"

"Wait. You're saying leap is an actual place? I thought it was an idea?"

"It is both. It's a place and an idea. The idea."

"Okay. Well where is it then?" Anika felt impatient with how this conversation was going.

"The thing I want you two to know is taht this map is old, and though we dogs know our realm back to front - or more to the point inside and out - we don't know the other realms in as intimate a way."

"So you're saying we'll probably get lost?"

Dan nods.

"I installed Anika with a gyrocompass, what else do we need?"

Dan laughs, but it's not a happy laugh.

'Guys listen. I know you're young but I have to level with you. I have no idea what you're going to see up there. Yes, game prep helps. But what happens when you meet your first adversary - and that adversary is armed?"

It was the second time Anika'd thought about violence in so many days. She'd been raised in Hex to repeat the mantra: You can win any game without bloodshed. She'd been taught that anything could be accomplished through diplomacy and nonviolent action. Deliberate nonviolent action.

She wasn't going to let her mom's voice, or a prairie dog's either, make her change course.

"Look. Dan. I know you mean well and all but I don't intend to do harm on the way to Leap." Her voice is escalating.

Lex's hair (blonde today, why can't he make up his mind?) in his eyes. He says, "Listen to the dog, Ani. He has a point. We're unarmed. And we don't know what we're going into."

"We're always unarmed. Because we're harmless!" Anika screeched these last few words, at the moment the earth shifted.

"That's one of us. Tunnel retrofit for our input/outputs."

At some point in the exchange he'd lit a cigar and the sweet smell of cloves again wafted in the air.

"Smoke?"

Lex nods as Anika makes a face.

"Let me get this straight." Anika stands upright, putting hands on hips. "You two are telling me that I might need to go into combat. I don't do combat."

"Unless it's verbal," Lex quips.

With Dan's help he lights his cigar. He inhales deep, "Oh this tastes sweet," he says.

"Vodka-soaked cherries," Dan responds. 

"Wait you're just gonna sit there smoking and drinking and I have to slay the dragons as it were please let it not be dragons."

"Ani, break. Remember the first rule."

Anika turns, disguted, grabs her bag and leaves the room. 

Crying, second time in so many days. Let's hope this isn't becoming a theme.

"I have some vodka-infused earthworms in there too. Hungry?" Anika hears Dan say to Lex as she closes the door rather too hard.

Lex in the adjacent room is shaking his head yes. These adjacencies makes Anika wonder if they can hear her thinking.

"I have to sit."

She reaches into her bag, pulls out a forest green cushion - and waves her hand over the auto-on. It auto inflates. She sets the zafu on the earthen floor, facing the wall, noticing the tracks the earthworms have made up and down its surface.

Tunnels in tunnels.

Breathing in, breathing out.

Anika feels what she's feeling. A mixture of disheartened, scared, annoyed and hurt. Her brain hangs on what Lex said about her being a violent communicator.

"He's right" she thinks.

"Fuck."

"Well. I guess now I have something to work with."

**

She taps into her core. It's the first thing you do when you go into meditation mode. You tap into your core and it gives you a view of what's going on in multiple levels. The first level, interior. The second immediate exterior. Third, what's going on on the perimeter. The fourth, if you're lucky, global view. The fifth, if you're double lucky and of age, a global view untainted by your own thoughts.

You have to clear through the debris of your own thoughts, ideas, opinions and questions even. That's how you get to the fourth. At the step between three and four you hear everything - the din in the wildeverse - and it has driven people mad. You know you're approaching when you hear the sound of wailing mixed with raspiness, as though there were words, and when you attempt to decipher them you're immediately dropped back a level.

So, you hear the din, and you sit still while you cross through it because any wrong move and you're popped out of meditation, and back into looking at a wall crawling with earthworms. 

*

This time, she clears the din. She comes out to the other side just long enough to see that she can't see. Everything is bright and blurry. There's no noise, no sound at all. Just pure, clear, clarity unlike any she's ever experienced.

Suddenly, back down into the din. Back into the noise and wailing.

**

What happens when you don't know which direction to go? Where do you go when all you have is a compass and the name of a place and some crackpot (that's a judgment) of a prairie dog telling you which way to go. And as if I have to kill someone.

"No, you don't have to kill anyone yet. First, you have to die."

That was the response.

What kind of game is this? She's never heard voices before. Where were these voices when she was locked (or, as the case turned out to be, not locked) in Hex? Who was saying this? And if it was her mom, why now?

Those are the thoughts, and as she follows each one she finds nothing about it is in the least settling. Meditation in Hex was always so simple. Sit down, empty your cup and visit the astral plane (that is, one through three but never four).

Maybe I should just go back? Maybe I'm not ready for this kind of work? I don't know who I am. I have no idea what to do with my life, or why I'm even going to Leap.

A knock at the door. It's Dan.

Hey Nika. Can I call you Nika? I have an idea. I've got a game and a couple buddies. We were thinking of taking a night to play this new game. It's a six player game and if you want to stick around a play, that's us three plus three of the others. What do you think?

"I don't know. I think me and Lex better be going. We don't know how much longer we have until we have to make the leap."

"I promise you won't run out of time. Just stick around. It's a great game and I know you guys love games. This one is one you won't forget. Besides, I think it'll help you on your journey."

*

They play the game in a similar way to eating dinner at home. They take a stack of cards (hex-shaped) at the beginning, and toss them out in front of them. There's a different constellation, world, landscape or task depicted in a picture on each hex. The more experienced players seem to know what to do, so Lex and Anika watch and mimic.

"Now, since you two are new to this," he points to Lex and Anika who are across the table from one another "why don't I walk you through it. Theo over there can help Lex. I'll help you, Anika. And Riley and Marlow you can just you know be here for moral support or to provide an alternative view should one arise in you."

"How many times have you played this?" 

"Check out our name tags. It shows."

Lex looked at each name tag. "Doesn't seem like much at all if one dot equals one game."

"No. That's one dot per hundred wins." Dan responds.

"Oh. We're way out of our league here," Lex asides to Anika.

Theo takes the speaker token. He's smoking a cigar, and the room is filling with the smell of gingerbread.

Ani runs her fingers along the periphery of the board table, taking in the feel of the cool metal. "This reminds me of home," she says. "Well, we're not that far from Hex, you know, just a few miles. We've borrowed some of your best games and merged them with our own."

Theo, the speaker (indicated by the speaker token - a purple orb glowing a few inches above the board in front of him) calls the game to order. Riley (they call him Riles, too) waves his hand, dimming the lights and throwing a flickering light under the board.

"Here's how this works. I'm going to run through it since wese have two new players and it never hurts to try to see this game as though for the first time...it requires beginners mind."

"We're all clear on beginners mind. Ook," says Theo. His voice is deep and reverberatey. His ample hair swings when he says "Ook..." pronounced ooohkay.

"The other thing you have to know, is you can win this game without ever going into conflict. Though there is the possibility of warfare, nobody has to die tonight," and he looks around at each player. His eyes look a little like the planet Jupiter, all grey and blue and striped, complete with a spot in the bottom left eye.

"Here's the other thing you gotta know. It's a long haul. We're probably talking several days and nights without sleep. If you need Rest, you have to take it when it's outside your turn."

Lex and Anika exchange glances.

"Final thing. The point of the game is to keep your tranquil at all times."

Anika thinks: there is no game. The game is played inside myself.

"That's right, Anika."

"What?"

"It's played inside yourself. And yes, when we're really listening to you, and have turned our own inner worlds down, we can hear your thoughts."

"Crikey," Lex breathes.

The ante upped. The pair had never played with bona fide mindreaders. (That is, unless Anika's mom and grandmother could hear and just never told her so; she'd had her hunches...)

"Alright. We've got some snacks in the kitch and we're ready. Let's do this."

Game play went thusly. 

Once you picked the tribe you wanted to represent, you read your strengths and weaknesses (though private, more advanced players were familiar with all the other tribes. Putting new players at a distinct disadvantage. Putting those who'd played before at a distinct advantage - they could play de- and offense).

Then, you put the board together. Best way to describe is it's a multi-platform game of tunnels, landscapes, and intrigue. You set up the board together and it's clear there are certain elements that you want to put in the way of the other players across the board. And still other hexes you want to keep near your home base. It's just unclear to a new player which is which.

"Why would you want to put that tunnel there?" Anika asked.

Theo answers, "you'll know soon enough."
