For a long time I thought I was a woman in tech, but really, I was a woman observing what was happening in tech. I was talking about it, I was doing what a lot of women claiming to be in tech do: I was talking and writing about tech.

Evangelizing about a product isn't a special talent, but learning to install linux on your machine, open up a terminal, and start programming takes time, patience, uninterrupted hours in front of a machine.

At the end of 2012, I moved into my grandparent's basement to learn to program. It's the hardest thing I've ever done. I have no social life. I've killed off all of my yammering profiles because I can't talk and program. It's just impossible. But I don't regret it. 

My message to all the women and ladies and girls and chicks and all of the other clever names we come up with for ourselves is: learn to program. 

If you call yourself a woman in tech, and I check your Github account and you don't have any repositories, you don't have any commits, and you haven't contributed to any open source projects, you are a woman observing the tech scene and pontificating about it. You are not a woman in tech, you are a woman watching tech. This isn't splitting hairs, this is calling bullshit on my past self, and any woman who makes a kerfluffle to get some attention so that she can avoid doing anything other than making commits on Github.

It's my experience that when you are focused on learning to program, making commits and sharpening your skills as a developer your gender will become a moot point. In every tech situation I've been in, when the focus is on the technology being created and deployed I've been treated as an equal to the other technologists in the room. 

Keep the focus on the tech, drop the woman thing, and get to work. 

When it comes down to it, it's impossible to discriminate against clean working code.
