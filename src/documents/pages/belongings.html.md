I've lived with little for years, inspired by the only book on simplicity I recommend, Duane Elgin's [Voluntary Simplicity](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Voluntary-Simplicity-Duane-Elgin/dp/0688121195). At the time I lived in a tiny dorm room at the University of East Anglia, in Norwich. I already lived with few belongings, and once I read Voluntary Simplicity I had more reasons to continue on the path.

During the nearly four years I lived in Japan I learned to appreciate the chibi kawaii, small and cute, way of living. I maintain a few small, but beautifully crafted, items can last a lifetime.

*About this list*

People contact me to ask about these things so frequently, I've create a page with this info. I'm not compensated in any way if you purchase any of the items on this page.

+ Bronners. I love it. I use it for everything. I took a 3 oz. bottle but wish I could have taken a gallon of the stuff. I hand washed my clothes with it, I wash my body with it, I'd drink it in a pinch.

+ Sonicare toothbrush. Invest in your teeth and gums, you don't want to have to replace them.

+ [Mission Workshop](http://missionworkshop.com/) bag. I own the best bag from Mission Workshop, and they don't make it anymore. Sorry. Also, bonus. If you're in SF talk with Morgan. Tell him Gwen says hey and that I actually did the RTW thing out of the bag he sold me.

+ [Outlier](http://outlier.cc/). US-based company making the best pants known to man. Wore a pair for a year straight while traveling the globe. Abe, the CEO, actually responded personally when I pitched him on a crazy idea from Singapore. In March 2013, I [went to his offices](http://gwenbell.com/posts/outlier) to thank him in person upon arriving in Brooklyn.

+ [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) The one book I own a physical copy of at the moment. Beautiful book, beautifully written and bound.

+ [Leica D-Lux 5](http://en.leica-camera.com/photography/compact_cameras/d-lux_5/) I bought this Leica in 2011 and have enjoyed it nearly every day since. Perfectly crafted, the photos it produces are a reflection of the care that went into creating this camera.

+ [Kimono](http://www.kimono-condoms.com/) Bill Gates is [requesting help](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/24/bill-gates-offers-100000-grant-improved-condoms/print/) from entrepreneurs to help make a better condom. I bet that'll take a little time. In the meantime, you'd do well to switch to Kimonos.

If you have a specific question about something I've mentioned in the past but no longer list here, [email me](mailto:gwen@gwenbell.com). I'll add it if it's something I still use.
