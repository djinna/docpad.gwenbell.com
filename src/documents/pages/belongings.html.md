I've lived with little for years, but the past year and a half I traveled the world with just one bag. Carrying everything you own in one bag as you travel is freeing. It's like learning to move all your weight into your own hands in crow.

This list in progress is an answer to the one question I get most often: what do you carry with you?

This isn't everything, but these are some of my belongings. The answer, not to the question 'what do you carry with you' but, 'what was so good you didn't delete it as you traveled?'

+ Bronners. I love it. I use it for everything. I took a 3 oz. bottle but wish I could have taken a gallon of the stuff. I hand washed my clothes with it, I wash my body with it, I would drink it in a pinch.

+ Sonicare toothbrush. Invest in your teeth and gums, you don't want to have to replace them.

+ [Mission Workshop](http://missionworkshop.com/) bag. I own the best bag from Mission Workshop, and they don't make it anymore. Sorry. Also, bonus. If you're in SF talk with Morgan. Tell him Gwen says hey and that I actually did the RTW thing out of the bag he sold me.

+ [Outlier](http://outlier.cc/). US-based company making the best pants known to man. They'll set you back a cool $225. I wore a pair for a year straight while traveling the globe. And Abe, the CEO, actually responded personally when I pitched him on a crazy idea from Singapore.

+ [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) The one book I own a physical copy of at the moment. Beautiful book, beautifully written and bound.
