I've lived with little for years, inspired by the only book on simplicity I recommend, Duane Elgin's [Voluntary Simplicity](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Voluntary-Simplicity-Duane-Elgin/dp/0688121195). At the time I lived in a tiny dorm room at the University of East Anglia, in Norwich. I already lived with few belongings, and once I read Voluntary Simplicity I had more reasons to continue on the path.

During the nearly four years I lived in Japan I learned to appreciate the chibi kawaii, small and cute, way of living. I maintain a few small, but beautifully crafted, items can last a lifetime.

About this list
---------------

I'm not compensated in any way if you purchase any of the items on this list. That's intentional; I don't do advertorials.

Self-care
---------

Where it comes to the body and well-being, I never skimp. I get my teeth checked every 6 to 8 months, I lengthen my spine on planes and I do yoga daily. On this:

+ [Manduka](http://www.manduka.com/us/shop/categories/products/mats/eko-superlite-travel-mat/) I have it in black. Though I love it, this is not for beginner practitioners. If you're a beginner, try [this one](http://www.gaiam.com/yoga-mats/premium-sticky-yoga-mat/95-0726,default,pd.html?start=4&cgid=3010400) from Gaiam - it's what I started on.

+ [Neti pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neti_pot). So sexy. Do it.

+ Bronners. I love it. I use it for everything. I took a 3 oz. bottle but wish I could have taken a gallon of the stuff. I hand washed my clothes with it, I wash my body with it, I'd drink it in a pinch. Though, that's [not recommend](http://brokelyn.com/tested-the-crazy-alleged-uses-of-dr-bronners-soap/) by Brokelyn.

+ Sonicare toothbrush. Invest in your teeth and gums, you don't want to have to replace them.

+ [Kimono](http://www.kimono-condoms.com/) Bill Gates is [requesting help](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/24/bill-gates-offers-100000-grant-improved-condoms/print/) from entrepreneurs to help make a better condom. I bet that'll take a little time. In the meantime, you'd do well to switch to Kimonos. The blue box.

Hardware
--------

+ Everything I own fits in this [Mission Workshop](http://missionworkshop.com/products/advanced_projects/vx-rucksack.php) bag. Nope, I don't rent a storage unit anywhere. Bonus. If you're in SF talk with Morgan. Tell him Gwen says hey and I actually did the RTW thing out of the bag he sold me.

+ [Outlier](http://outlier.cc/). US-based company making the best pants known to man. Wore a pair for a year straight while traveling the globe. Abe, the CEO, actually responded personally when I pitched him on a crazy idea from Singapore. In March 2013, I [went to his offices](http://gwenbell.com/posts/outlier) to thank him in person upon arriving in Brooklyn.

+ [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) The one book I own a physical copy of at the moment. Beautiful book, beautifully written and bound.

+ [Leica D-Lux 5](http://en.leica-camera.com/photography/compact_cameras/d-lux_5/) I bought this Leica in 2011 and have enjoyed it nearly every day since. Perfectly crafted, the photos it produces are a reflection of the care that went into creating this camera.

+ [iPod Nano Watch](http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/29/hex-ships-ipod-nano-watch-band-dares-you-to-destroy-it-video/) I don't own a phone. I sold my iPhone in the Mission in SF in January 2012. No, I don't miss owning a phone. Never. Still, when Patrick offered me his circa 2010 Nano watch in Japan in July 2012, I said yes. Because I wanted to know the time, and I wanted to jam out to the beats. So, this little watch means a lot to me. I get complimented on it constantly. My hunch is Apple is overlooking a massive niche market with this.

+ [MacBook Air](https://www.apple.com/macbookair/) Been around the whole globe with me. I put Linux on it for six months, and am now back to the OSX. I program on it, and I write on it, and I live with this machine.

If you have a specific question about something I've mentioned in the past but no longer list here, [email me](mailto:gwen@gwenbell.com). I'll add it if it's something I still use.
