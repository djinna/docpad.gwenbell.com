## Sometimes asked questions

I asked [Ross Hill](http://rosshill.com.au) if he'd be willing ask me some questions for this SAQ (sometimes asked questions). He obliged, from Hanoi, Vietnam with, 'Here are a selection of direct questions for your consideration. Take your pick GB!'

## Why do you post things (a stream) online? 

The stream is an honest reflection of what I'm working on in that moment.

## What's stopping you from drinking coffee in Melbourne? 

Zero. I think Melbourne is coming into its own. And through your eyes, I have begun to fall for the place.

## What do you do each day? (practices) 

I write each day. I practice yoga and I do upper body strength practices. I drink coffee and talk with other people doing the work. I [commit](http://github.com/gwenbell) each day.

## How do you earn bitcoins? (to live) 

I don't earn enough bitcoins to thrive in the world yet. Not enough businesses accept them yet. 

At the start of 2013 I decided I want to try and earn completely in btc by the end of the year. (And honestly, I wanted to do that at the start of 2012!) That may be a tall order. People are clinging to their bitcoins right now because the price is going up and up.

Or the bottom could completely fall out of the dollar when people see that quantitive easing is more than something to shake our collective heads at. It's droppping the bottom out of the currency. I want to be off the USD by the end of 2013. 

## What is it about chat.gwenbell.com that is so compelling, in a world where every site is 'social'? 

This is one that I've been asking myself. It's several things. One, no 'audience'. I think the term is now dead. Writers can't use it anymore. We might have peers, or we might have peeps who read. But I don't see myself as having an 'audience'. I am not the queen of England.

Now, that takes some of the pressure off. Having no audience, and nobody to perform for, the pressure is off. We can just chat and shoot the shit. We don't have to be anything for anyone. It feels small, cozy, like a salon. We don't have bullhorns, nor do we need them. We're not 'marketing' anything or trying to 'sell' to each other.

I see things like chat.gwenbell as something more people will want as they see that they can't be tiny, or weird, or funny but not side-splitting funny, enough. Social has gone some directions I just can't hang with, including there's no tiny corners in which to have little conversations that are off the record. 

I want parts of the web that are written in disappearing ink. So I make them! If I could write the whole of the web in disappearing ink, I would. Just because something can be around forever, replicated across infinitely replicating servers, should it be?

You know when you're on chat.gwenbell that I don't keep a record of it. All my source code is open for you to look at. You can't say the same of any major site whose sole reason to exist is to sell ads against your name, face and reputation.

## Cloud life only just became viable, so why disconnect from it all now? 

The cloud is not new; it's just been rebranded by some clever folks in marketing.

The cloud is just a bunch of machines connected up to a bunch more machines. I'm not completely disconnected right now, but for instance deleting my google account came out of a very direct conversation with someone in Kansas City last fall at the Google Fiber launch. I'm leaving his name OTR for his privacy, but the work he's doing is just wonderful, and weird, and hard.

He helped me see that Google isn't a benevolent overlord. He explained the Google Fiber people were laying down fiber, next to fiber, next to fiber. And charging people in just the same way all the other ISPs are doing. Every major ISP in this country is gouging its users. And as far as I know, the only recourse is for people to start talking to people - their neighbors, and getting mesh networks going themselves.

I pulled totally off Google products. I deleted my six year old gmail account. I don't miss it. I feel free, as Richard Stallman likes to say, Free as in Freedom.

It's a tradeoff. I can't join Google Groups now because I don't have an account. You now have to have an account to download things from the Google Chrome store. I get around it by forcing myself to learn new pathways: I use Mozilla products instead, for instance. The most convenient route is not always the best. 

## Why did you give up social? 

I recently joined the new Myspace. I'm on IRC. I am on Hyperboria. 

I quit social sites whose sole existence is to earn revenue off users. Myspace could probably go that direction fast, so I'm watching that.

I have an internal compass. When I hit grey area, I will still stay with a product if I have deep connections to it. In the case of Twitter, I did. I used to grant interviews about Twitter to local papers, when people just didn't get the power of it. I had to convince people: y'all. Twitter is the future. Wake up! And for a time, it was. That was 2007, 2008. But now, it's the past. It's built on old, closed software. I don't know what the code base looks like. The best thing that has come out of Twitter in years is Bootstrap.

Now, that's not to disparage the early days of Twitter. It was a brilliant idea whose time had come. I've met Jack Dorsey (once, at a very small party like chat.gwenbell, actually). I walked up to him with tears in my eyes - that's no overstatement - and I thanked him for what he'd brought into the world.

At the same time, it's a very different thing than it was. I had to leave.

## Why are you living in a basement? Why are you living in America? How do you decide where to live? 

I moved into my grandmother's basement at the end of 2012. I'd traveled the globe looking for what's next in tech. It took me all over the world and I didn't find it out there. Actually, a lot of screens showed the same blue box that is F---book. That's where a lot of people were. I blame that addiction for killing off much of the ingenuity amongst entrepreneurs. Yes! Get mad and send angry emails if you want; I am 100% sure it's a cess pool in there.

I'm in the basement because it was the basement or the streets in the snow in Colorado. One of the people I got closest to at the end of 2012 was someone who lives in a van. His name is Erik, and he's brilliant and doesn't live in an ordinary home like ordinary Americans. The more I talked with him, the more I saw how genuine his practice was, the closer I wanted to be to it. I believe he's one of the most gifted teachers I've ever met.

Anyway, he helped me see why I should turn my 2010 MacBook Air into a Linux box. Which I did for six months (back on the OS X now until I can get a box that makes more sense for Linux). 

But those conversations, and his extreme stoicism. Holy shit! You know, just how Boulder wouldn't exist if it weren't for people like him slinking around in his oversized sweaters, smoking hand-rolled cigs, talking all kinds of shit about the yuppies, but since he was born there, knowing there was part of him that was, too.

So, I was prepared for a winter of Stoic street life in my mind. But not in my body. I was scrawny by that point. My grandmother suggested in no uncertain terms I come back to Carolina. I did. I moved into the basement, and for the past six months have been fattening up, muscling up, programming like mad and I guess I'm still a writer, even if it breaks me again.

Maybe because it breaks me.

## Why do you delete the end of your stream? 

What is there to see of any interest past one month back? I think it should be shorter! I think it should be just a week long. But, I keep it at a month for now because if you're a first time reader on the site you need at least a little somethin' to get your bearings.

What is not ephemeral? What about the web leads people to think it's going to be around forever? We're all passing as we speak. Anything I'm precious about I work hard to root out - most of all, my own cherished beliefs about myself.

(Side note: because I commit on Github, there's always technically a record of everything. And as you pointed out, Ross, crawlers crawl - nothing is completely gone, but what I choose to display is like a bonsai tree I'm constantly trimming.)

## In a world of untethering, what do you hold closest? 

Everything is on the chopping block.

## What is it about Google Glass that scares you? 

Glass humors me more than it scares me.

## What is it about Google that scares you? 

As above, it humors me more than scares me. That's because they don't have access to any of my data anymore. Well, nothing new. Nothing past when I deleted my profile and stopped giving the company access to my work. I don't use any of their products anymore.

## What is it about Twitter that scares you? 

Nothing scares me about Twitter. As with Google, it is the company itself I am not aligned with. Also, I see it as part of the oldernet, the dying web.

The fact that Twitter no longer scared, or delighted, or thrilled, or intrigued me - that's the reason I left. I was apathetic about it by the time I deleted my account nearly two years ago now.

## What excites you most? 

I am fascinated by the new, emerging web on Hyperboria. I'm curious about Bitcoin. I'm fascinated by people in the Node community. I read several books a week. Most recently two graphic novels: [A Chinese Life](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/oct/12/chinese-life-li-kunwu-p-otie-review) and [Calling Dr Laura](http://nicolejgeorges.com/?page_id=157).

## What are the common qualities of the people you connect with? 

The people I connect with most share this quality: they are indefatiguable. They are always trying new things and believe that burning boats keeps their vitality up. 

## Is Ev Bogue a robot? 

You will have to ask him that.

## What are you looking for over the horizon? 

I'm into something huge in the CJDNS, Hyperboria world. I know Bitcoin, if not something superior to it, is going to be huge. Node, JavaScript and the real-time web are coming; they're not yet fully here.

I trust my gut in all things. Sometimes I have to hold very still while things are arriving to avoid rabbit starvation.

## Why do you think people need to code? 

It's the only thing I agree with Rushkoff on: program or be programmed.

## Which sites do you load every day? 

I load [Preev](http://preev.com/) to check how Bitcoin's holding up. I check Hyperboria. [Socialno.de](http://socialno.de/gwen) (Hyperboria only link) is a source of nourishment. I commit code to [Github](https://github.com/gwenbell). I pop into stackvm on [irc](http://subway.gwenbell.com/). I check in on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/). I check my email with Thunderbird. If I need to search for something I use duckduckgo.com. When coding, I use Sublime Text 2. I listen to the new myspace when I'm working out. I check into [pinboard.in](http://pinboard.in/u:gwenbell) about once a week. I read no blogs on a regular basis.

## What is inside Hyperboria?

We're just now figuring that out.

## Why oh why am I listening to the Titanic soundtrack at this cafe in Hanoi? 

Ha!
