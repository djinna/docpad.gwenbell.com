Git is a version control system. Regardless of how often you touch code, if you're in tech, you'll benefit from knowing how git works, and how to use the command line (basics, to start). Once you know git, you'll know where things are in the development process (even if it's just by knowing how to create a pull request, to talk with your dev team on their terms).

Git party
-------------

We get together either in a WebRTC room or in person. I demonstrate. You practice on your own machine. We build and deploy a Node.js app together. If one on one, I tailor the session to your deployment needs.

In a way, knowing the secrets of git gives you insight into how developers think, letting them do the work they do best, so you have the best possible product you can create.
