Gitting Things Done with Gwen Bell
---

Git is a version control management system. It's the singlemost important technology I use right now. See my current commits to git [here](https://github.com/gwenbell).

**Why Learn Git** 

I can't tell you the number of people I know who manage large code bases and don't use version control. I'm not sure why, but since I've learned git, I won't go back to doing it the hard way.

**What You'll Learn**

No matter your current skill level (and if you're a dev person, most of this will be review) everyone on your team will benefit from gitting things done together. You'll learn

+ how to document your work using a git workflow
+ how to manage projects across space/time/multiple team members
+ how to deploy (either something from scratch or Docpad, depending on your team's comfort level with git)
+ how to create and merge pull requests
+ the basics of git and Github (and the difference between the two)
+ how to clone into and play with some of the amazing open source projects available on Github

**What We'll Do**

We'll get together in a room, and everyone will work on their computers. I'll demonstrate commands at the front of the room, and you'll practice on your own machine. We'll build and deploy a Node.js app together, from the bare bones.

**Results**

Regardless of how often you touch code, you'll benefit from knowing how git works. Once you know git, you'll know where things are in the development process (even if it's just by knowing how to create a pull request, to talk with your dev team on their terms).

In a way, knowing the secrets of git gives you insight into how developers think, letting them do the work they do best, so you have the best possible product you can create.

**Git In It**

When you reach out, let me know about the size of your team, the scope of the project you're creating, and your current team work flow.
