I've taught tech the past few years. Before that I taught yoga in my yoga studio in Yokohama. Before that I taught English Kiryu. Before that I taught English in Tokyo. I love teaching. It's what I'm called to do. 

I teach new tech. Starting with git - which is a [version control system](http://git-scm.com/), I teach one on one (over WebRTC) and in person. I can help you get your own VPS up and running so you can run Node and get a site up and running in a few hours. It's about self-reliance. You can do all this on your own, but sometimes you need tech support. I can help.

Why Learn Git
-------------

Git is a version control management system. It's the singlemost important technology I use right now. See my current commits to git [here](https://github.com/gwenbell).

I can't tell you the number of people I know who manage large code bases and don't use version control. I'm not sure why, but since I've learned git, I won't go back to doing it the hard way.

What You'll Learn
-----------------

No matter your current skill level (and if you're a dev person, most of this will be review) everyone on your team will benefit from gitting things done together. You'll learn

+ how to document your work using a git workflow
+ how to manage projects across space/time/multiple team members
+ how to deploy (either something from scratch or Docpad, depending on your team's comfort level with git)
+ how to create and merge pull requests
+ the basics of git and Github (and the difference between the two)
+ how to clone into and play with some of the amazing open source projects available on Github

What We'll Do
-------------

We'll get together, either in a WebRTC room or in person. I'll demonstrate commands at the front of the room, and you'll practice on your own machine. We'll build and deploy a Node.js app together, from the bare bones. If one on one, I tailor the session to your deployment needs.

Results
-------

Regardless of how often you touch code, if you're in tech, you'll benefit from knowing how git works. Once you know git, you'll know where things are in the development process (even if it's just by knowing how to create a pull request, to talk with your dev team on their terms).

In a way, knowing the secrets of git gives you insight into how developers think, letting them do the work they do best, so you have the best possible product you can create.

Git In It
---------

When you reach out, let me know about the size of your team, the scope of the project you're creating, and your current team work flow.
