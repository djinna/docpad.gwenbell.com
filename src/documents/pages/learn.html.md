Here's a technology I think has changed the world, but it's pretty underappreciated. It's git. Git is a version control system. Since I've learned git, I won't go back to doing it the hard way. It's now a part of my daily process. If you want to learn it, but don't want to do it on your own, I can help.

What I can teach you
--------------------

+ how to document your work using a git workflow
+ how to manage projects across space/time/multiple team members
+ how to create your own deployables
+ how to create and merge pull requests
+ the basics of git to get up and running (cloning in, making commits, pushing and pulling)

What We'll Do
-------------

We get together either in a WebRTC room or in person. I demonstrate. You practice on your own machine. We build and deploy a Node.js app together, from the bare bones. If one on one, I tailor the session to your deployment needs.

Regardless of how often you touch code, if you're in tech, you'll benefit from knowing how git works. Once you know git, you'll know where things are in the development process (even if it's just by knowing how to create a pull request, to talk with your dev team on their terms).

In a way, knowing the secrets of git gives you insight into how developers think, letting them do the work they do best, so you have the best possible product you can create.

Bonus: if you're not a developer, but you work with developers, you can see if they're actually working or just playing on the command line to look busy.

Who am I to teach you?
----------------------

I teach. Before this, I taught yoga in my yoga studio in Yokohama. Before that I taught English in Kiryu. Before that, I taught English in Tokyo. Before that, at a meditation retreat with Thich Nhat Hanh I was given the Buddhist name Lovely Teacher of the Heart. What can I say, it stuck.

I start with git - a [version control system](http://git-scm.com/). I can work with you one on one (over WebRTC) and in person. I can help you get your own VPS up and running so you can run Node and get a site up and running in a few hours. 

It's about self-reliance. You can do all this on your own, but sometimes you need tech support. I can help.
