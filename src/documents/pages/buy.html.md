I live out of one bag, and have for more than a year. This is in answer to the one questions I get most often: what do you carry with you?

I prefer the question: what didn't you leave behind? These things, I didn't leave behind. These products reflect craftsmanship, longevity and beauty. Side: I don't make any money off you spending yours on these things.

+ Bronners. I love it. I use it for everything. I took a 3 oz. bottle but wish I could have taken a gallon of the stuff.

+ Sonicare toothbrush. Invest in your teeth and gums, you don't want to have to replace them.

+ [Mission Workshop](http://missionworkshop.com/) bag. I own the best bag from Mission Workshop, and they don't make it anymore. Sorry. Also, bonus. If you're in SF talk with Morgan. Tell him Gwen says hey and that I actually did the RTW thing out of the bag he sold me.

+ [Outlier](http://outlier.cc/). US-based company making the best pants known to man. They'll set you back a cool $225. I wore a pair for a year straight while traveling the globe. And Abe, the CEO, actually responded personally when I pitched him on a crazy idea from Singapore.

+ [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) The one book I own a physical copy of at the moment. Beautiful book, beautifully written and bound.
