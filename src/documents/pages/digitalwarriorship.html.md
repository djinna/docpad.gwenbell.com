Intro
---

I published _Digital Warriorship_ for the first time two years ago, in 2011. I republished it in 2012. Now, here it is for 2013. 

This is a guide to some ways you might approach your digital life as a warrior. It's the guide I live by, and I hope it'll help you as it helps me. As with everything I've written, I hope you'll take what works for you and discard the rest.

I'm publishing Digital Warriorship here as I write it, starting 27 January 2013. Most recent update: 29 January 2013.

Guiding Principles/Faeries
---

From 2011 to 2013 I've learned about technologies that have changed my worldview. Pioneers in the field of information technology - notably [Richard Stallman](http://www.stallman.org/) (be sure to view source) and [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) and this [talk on git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8). These two have served as sort of guiding faeries (dude, programmery faeries that is).

As you read about those two you'll see the driving force is open source and free, as in freedom, software, hardware and community. Stallman goes to great lengths to distinguish between the two. Each is passionate about a more open web. Their digital values align with mine, though they've been at it longer and taken different paths.

Out of open/free comes a tool I've already mentioned, git. And from git, [GitHub](http://github.com/) emerged. 

Git In It
--- 

The purpose of git is multifold. Here are just a few reasons to commit some hours to learning it.

+  Multiple people can work on a single code base
+  Git tracks versions, letting you see a record of commits 
+  This minimizes the need for trust

If you'd like to get a sense of what I'm working on right now, you can see my [commits here](http://github.com/gwenbell/).

You may take one look at git, or GitHub, and think it's all just programmers hanging out deploying all night and day. What on earth would you get out of that if you're not a programmer?

To practice digital warriorship in 2013, you have to commit and deploy, or at minimum know what those words mean. Let's start with fundamentals.

Tools
---

**HTML & CSS**

Two of the fundamental tools are CSS and HTML. Armed with these two tools you can build your own basic site, and feel the rush of excitement of having done so.

If you're just starting out and you're a visual learner, you might try a Visual Quickstart guide. I learned HTML and CSS from a [Visual Quickstart guide](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/HTML-XHTML-CSS/Elizabeth-Castro/e/9780321430847). I was in Japan, and though I'd published to a blog for a while, I was tired of the same boring LiveJournal templates. I decided to code my first website.

As I watched Ari and Yuutsu, the red eared sliders, jump off their floating rock and try to climb out of their homemade tank, I learned the basics of coding. I just locked myself in until I got the basics. I know of no better way than to learn and publish until it looks how you want. 

Along with books, I've enjoyed extending my skill set with [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/). 

**Git**

I've already touched on this, and if you already know some HTML and CSS, next stop is to get a grasp on git. In addition to the Torvalds video above, Git Pro's a great [place to start](http://git-scm.com/book).

**System**

In 2012 I decided I'd gone as far as I want to go with Apple's operating system. While satisfied with the hardware I was no longer excited about the direction the OS was going. When I notice I'm irritated with one of my tools I start exploring other options.

I started asking people about Linux. The more I learned, the more I realized I wanted to install it on my machine. I'm running a distribution (distro) of Linux - [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download). If you have the mind to do it, you can get Ubuntu onto a MacBook Air.

About Digital Warriorship
---

Why warriorship? For 3.5 years I lived in the cloud-shrouded mountain town that is Boulder, Colorado. I moved there in 2007 because I found it to be a balance of tech savvy and yogic prowess. 

I took my first yoga class in college, became certified to teach in 2005 and opened a yoga studio in Japan that same year. During my 3.5 years in Japan I taught and studied yoga, Buddhism and Japanese culture. Being a warrior means something in each of these cultures. In yoga we're taught the three warrior postures. You can take them in sequence, warriors one two and three. Each warrior is a practice in balance.

In Japanese culture, warriors are samurai, they're ninjas. And, they're monks. Because many who trained to be warriors also trained to be practitioners. It wasn't enough to know how to chop a man up. You had to do it with dignity and grace.

Then there's the warrior path in Shambhala Buddhism. It's choosing to be a warrior, taking the warrior's path - committing yourself to practice for the enlightenment of all beings. 

So that's warriorship, and the digital part. Well you wouldn't be here reading this if you didn't already know.

About the Author
---

I wrote the first version of Digital Warriorship from December 2010 to February 2011. I published that first version, the first ebook I'd written, along with the launch of a new site called Ebookling. It was snowing in Boulder, and before I published I printed the manuscript and combed over it, seated with the pages all around me.

I wrote the second version in San Francisco, and updated it in Japan in 2012. The focus was on meeting your own needs before and while you are engaged in your digital worlds.

The practice of digital warriorship is my life's work.
