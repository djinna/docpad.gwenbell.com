p Self-employed since 2005, I am a full-time web developer and technical writer. The several thousand who support my work are scattered across the world.

p Personal Bio: I started my first business - a yoga studio - in Japan in 2005, after teaching in a Japanese elementary school in Gunma-ken, Kiryu-shi for a year. 

p Personal Guidelines: I travel light. I live out of one bag and am easy on the Earth. I believe what we say matters and each word and action carries a reverberation.

p Favorite Things: <a href="http://www.hbo.com/six-feet-under">Six Feet Under</a>, the <a href="https://new.myspace.com/gwenbell">New Myspace</a>, <a href="http://brooklyn-spaces.com/2011/09/the-schoolhouse/">The Schoolhouse</a> in Brooklyn, Perfect Shots of Espresso and Tiny Cacti
