Consider these digital love letters.

**[Alan Ball](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0050332/)**

I started watching Six Feet Under and didn't stop until I'd seen every episode. Alan Ball also wrote one of my all-time favorite films, American Beauty. 

Themes: death, family dynamics (shenpa), honesty, sex
 
**[Hayao Miyazaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki)**

I spent hours wandering the Ghibli Museum one winter in Japan. It's his attention to detail, strong storytelling skills and magic - he captures the way a child perceives, and handles that input, that sensory overload, in a decidedly grown up way. 

Themes: Japan, magic, growth, destruction, the natural world, childhood

**My grandmother, Nunu**

After my mom died I became a ward of the court. My grandparents adopted me, helped me change my name and from then on raised me as one of their own. 

Themes: love, death, support, life

**[Della Pollock](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/remembering-della-pollock/1100413031?ean=9781403963475)**

Della Pollock burst into the classroom and... mastered the universe that unfolded there. Oral history, one of the last electives I took at Carolina. 

The only one that taught me to listen to what's _behind_ the words.

Themes: interviews, listening, storytelling

**[Kate Crisp](http://www.prisondharmanetwork.net/profile/katecrisp)**

Kate Crisp helped me onto the warrior path by never taking any of my shit. Also, she introduced me to NVC and that changed everything. I am grateful to her for it.

Themes: practice, nvc, engaged Buddhism, warriorship

**[Patrick Reynolds](http://thepeakconditionproject.com/)**

Patrick Reynolds. It's impossible for me to capture him in words (though [I tried, once](http://www.elephantjournal.com/2010/02/ive-got-a-yoga-crush-on-patrick-reynolds-gwen-bell/)). We met in 1999. I've never met another human like him. If he died, when he dies, anything I say to memorialize him will come up short. I'll probably just take the podium and sob.

Themes: Japan, Zen, video games

**[Ev Bogue](http://evbogue.com)**

Ev Bogue is my star twin. 

Themes: work, love, coffee
