These people and their work influences mine. Consider these digital love letters.

**[Alan Ball](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0050332/)**

I started watching Six Feet Under and didn't stop until I'd see every episode. Alan Ball also wrote one of my all-time favorite films, American Beauty. 

Themes: death, family dynamics (shenpa), honesty, sex
 
**[Hayao Miyazaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki)**

I spent hours wandering the Ghibli Museum one winter in Japan. It's his attention to detail, strong storytelling skills and magic - he captures the way a child perceives, and handles that input, that sensory overload, in a decidedly grown up way. 

Themes: Japan, magic, growth, destruction, the natural world, childhood
