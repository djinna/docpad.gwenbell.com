**[Alan Ball](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0050332/)**

I started watching Six Feet Under and didn't stop until I'd seen every episode. Alan Ball also wrote one of my all-time favorite films, American Beauty. 

Themes: death, family dynamics (shenpa), honesty, sex
 
**[Hayao Miyazaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki)**

I spent hours wandering the Ghibli Museum one winter in Japan. It's his attention to detail, strong storytelling skills and magic - he captures the way a child perceives, and handles that input, that sensory overload, in a decidedly grown up way. 

Themes: Japan, magic, growth, destruction, the natural world, childhood

**My grandmother, Nunu**

After my mom died I became a ward of the court. My grandparents adopted me, helped me change my name and from then on raised me as one of their own. 

Themes: love, death, support, life

**[Della Pollock](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/remembering-della-pollock/1100413031?ean=9781403963475)**

Della Pollock burst into the classroom and... mastered the universe that unfolded there. Oral history, one of the last electives I took at Carolina. 

The only one that taught me to listen to what's _behind_ the words.

Themes: interviews, listening, storytelling

**[Kate Crisp](http://www.prisondharmanetwork.net/profile/katecrisp)**

Kate Crisp helped me onto the warrior path by never taking any of my shit. Also, she introduced me to NVC and that changed everything. I am grateful to her for it.

Themes: practice, nvc, engaged Buddhism, warriorship

**[Patrick Reynolds](http://thepeakconditionproject.com/)**

Patrick Reynolds. It's impossible for me to capture him in words (though [I tried, once](http://www.elephantjournal.com/2010/02/ive-got-a-yoga-crush-on-patrick-reynolds-gwen-bell/)). We met in 1999. I've never met another human like him. If he died, when he dies, anything I say to memorialize him will come up short. I'll probably just take the podium and sob.

Themes: Japan, Zen, video games

**[Ev Bogue](http://evbogue.com)**

Ev Bogue is my star twin. 

Themes: work, love, coffee

**Amy Cotteleer** 

I met Amy at a Nintendo event in Chicago. I didn't know I'd sat next to the organizer of the event, and [president of the company A2G](http://www.advocacyamplified.com/2011/03/a2g%E2%80%99s-amy-cotteleer-weighs-in-on-consumer-engagement-in-usa-today-2/), until later. At the event I was by turns delighted, moved, touched - happy - all night. Amy radiated warmth. Along with Justine Meek, her right hand (the woman who brought me into the role of Nintendo ambassador - by flying in to meet me) - Amy taught me ways to build loyalty, and run a business with panache. 

**Tanya Quick**

Tanya runs [Language Dept.](http://languagedept.com). Together, along with Jenn Cash, her business partner, we rebuilt gwenbell.com in 2010 and 2011. Somewhere in there we cohosted a tweetup in their giant lofted NYC office. I admire Tanya's work ethic, her life-forward way of doing things, her _drive_.

**[Mike Hearn](http://plan99.net/~mike/)**

I think Mike Hearn is a cryptographic genius. Because of his influence, and this [talk he gave at Bitcoin2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD4L7xDNCmA), I am obsessed with the world of bitcoin, and it's possibilities to change the world (especially through smart property).
