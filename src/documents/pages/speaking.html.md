I love helping people learn about technology. If you have an event coming up for which you need someone to speak about tech, I'm available to speak on these topics:

+ Git
+ Node.js
+ The real-time web environment (high-level intro/overview)
+ NPM
+ Javascript (basics)
+ Bootstrap
+ Github
+ Peer to peer technologies, including Bitcoin
