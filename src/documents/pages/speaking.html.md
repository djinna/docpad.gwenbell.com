Gitting Things Done with Gwen Bell
---

I'm not a developer, and I love git. I use it daily. If I could track everything I do...if I could go back in time and use git for every project...I would. It's the singlemost important technology I use right now. If your team isn't using it yet, let's sort that out.

**Why Learn Git** 

It's a skill every person on your team - community managers, photo editors, designers, everyone -benefits from learning. Rather than making your team better at communication, git makes it so you need to communicate less. And that's a _good thing_.

**What You'll Learn**

No matter your current skill level (and if you're a dev person, I know most of this will be review) everyone on your team will benefit from gitting things done together. You'll learn

+ how to document your work using a git workflow
+ how to manage projects across space/time/multiple team members
+ how to deploy (either something from scratch or Docpad, depending on your team's comfort level with git)
+ how to create and merge pull requests
+ the basics of git and Github (and the difference between the two)
+ how to clone into and play with some of the amazing open source projects available on Github

**Results**

When you adopt git at your office (or, if you're a remote team, remotely) everyone benefits. Regardless of how often you touch code, you'll benefit from knowing how git works. No matter the piece of the puzzle on which you work, you'll know where things are in the development process (even if it's just by knowing how to create a pull request, to talk with your dev team on their terms).

This is beneficial to your dev team, too. You make less in person requests, and play on their level. In a way, knowing the secrets of git gives you insight into how to developers think, letting them do the work they do best, so you have the best possible product you can create.

**Let's Git In It**

When you [get in touch](/pages/contact), let me know about the size of your team, the scope of the project you're creating, and your current team work flow.
