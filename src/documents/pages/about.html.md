Professional Brief
---

I built my first business in Japan, a yoga studio that was profitable from its second month and grew for six years. 

I've been featured on the cover of [Experience Life magazine](http://shanerichphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/bitter3.jpg). That month I shared shelf-space with Oprah. I've been honored to be named one of Fast Company's most influential women in tech. I've spoken at dozens of tech events, co-founded half a dozen companies, including Buddhist Geeks.

I've had the rare opportunity to be a brand ambassador for Nintendo, done commercial for HP and been a panelist on a panel called, perhaps a touch cheekily, Titans of Tech. I've spoken all over the country, and taught workshops to hundreds of people. Most recently, I've traveled the globe, supporting myself by launching ebooks and guided courses to subscriber inboxes.

Personal Bio
---

I take my life seriously. And for a lot of years, I took myself seriously, too. Somehow*, over the past two years I've managed to get over myself. 

I still take life seriously. I don't expect my life to stretch on forever. I tell the people I love that I love them. I tell the people who matter to me that they matter to me. I put my health first, the people I love second and the work third. 

I do the work every day of the week, without a break. I don't take weekends or holidays. I rest when I need to, and work when I'm not resting. I've only had one full-time job; teaching English to little kids in Japan. For only full-time jobs to have, that is the ideal one. I got to create whatever games I wanted and have little Japanese kids try them out. For pay.

That year, while I taught English, I opened a yoga studio above an izakaya. It was perpetually cold. The tatami mats we rolled our mats out on were ratty and old. Yet things went so well my compadre and I decided to move to Yokohama and do it a second time, for realzies. 

The business was a mainstay in the community for six years. When I visited Japan again in the summer of 2012, one of my former students stopped me in the street and asked when I'd be re-opening the studio. I felt so touched I was tempted to say, 'today'.

I have been wildly, deeply blessed. I was raised by my grandparents after my mom died. They could have put me in foster care, and I know some foster kids make it out ok, but I didn't have to. Instead, I ended up being able to do pretty much anything I could think up - from tap dance lessons, and yes I still remember some of my moves - to traveling the entire world. And that was just the first time (I packed too much; the second time I just took one bag).

I've taken some knocks, y'all. I'm not going to lie. But I've also had the opportunity to recover from them, thanks largely to the [people by whom I'm influenced](/pages/influences). 

I'm not sure what's next. I only promise you I will continue to do the work. What else can we do, other than use our lives to serve others and prepare for death? 

*Thank you, NVC.
