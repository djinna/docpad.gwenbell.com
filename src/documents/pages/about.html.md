Hi. I'm Gwen Bell. Writer, traveler, beginner programmer, rope jumper,  tea drinker (I prefer darkest of the dark pu erh, sencha, yerba mate, opinionated teas of all sort). Most recent interests include meat, as I've come off twelve years of vegetarianism to find out meat's pretty alright.

Tech

I built this site on <a href="https://github.com/gwenbell/docpad">DocPad</a>, which is nothing short of magic. 

The tech stack I'm employing includes: Node.js, Jade, Stylus, Markdown. Design: Bootstrap. 

Hardware: 13" MBA running Ubuntu 12.04.

Bio

Since 2004 I've traveled the globe, doing the work. 

During 2012 I traveled to Mexico and San Francisco. Then to Singapore, spent a few months in Japan, then on to Berlin.

As of 2013, I split my time between the coasts.
