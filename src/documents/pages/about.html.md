TL;DR: Sex, Tech + the Real-time Web
------------------------------------

I'm interested in border-free convention-free rule-free label-free technologies. This is why I get paid in Bitcoin, code in Node.js, live on the command line, commit to git, and do only writer-programmery-things.

*

I only write about tech because it's sexy.

I'm a polyamorous bisexual cyborg. 

Prior to this moment, I killed off everything. All of my products, most of my relationships, to live out of one bag travel the world learn everything I could about technology. When I noticed no one else was building what I wanted, so I have to build it myself. 

In Oakland. Because in my estimation, that's where all the people doing the work are right now.

I believe in a world where everything is decentralized, and we're all gender-fluid.

I want to make that world happen by doing it myself.

I program because I need to shape things from the inside, and this is the best way to shape it.

Besides I always thought programmers were very sexy. That's why I decided to become one.

The end.
