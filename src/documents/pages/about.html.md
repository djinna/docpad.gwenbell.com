I only write about tech because it's sexy.

I'm a polyamorous bisexual cyborg.

I'm trying to get to SF so I can either learn from and/or make out with technologists.

I will only make out with you if I learn from you, too.

I killed off everything. All of my products, most of my relationships, to live out of one bag travel the world learn everything I could about technology and then noticed no one else was building what I wanted, so I have to build it myself. In SF.

I believe in a world where everything is decentralized, and we're all gender-fluid.

I want to make that world happen by doing it myself.

I'm interested in border-free convention-free rule-free label-free technologies. 

This is why I'm into Bitcoin, Node.js, and writer-programmery-things.

If I could just write and get all of that I would, but I think I have to do it by being in the code itself.

I need to shape it from the inside.

Besides I always thought programmers were very sexy. That's why I decided to become one.

The end.
