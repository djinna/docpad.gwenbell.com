Hi. I'm Gwen Bell. I'm a technology consultant, programmer and writer.

Tech
---

I built this site on DocPad. Tech stack: Node.js, Jade, Stylus, Markdown. Design: Bootstrap, Subtle Patterns. Hardware: 13" MBA running Ubuntu 12.04.

I started publishing to the web in 2003. I built my first site in 2004. I was teaching English at Yamamae Elementary in Kiryu-shi, Japan. 

Everything I know about tech I taught myself. I opened a book and taught myself HTML and CSS. Then, I launched my first business, a yoga studio in Yokohama, Japan. I built and maintained the site for the business. Then, a few years later, I started doing freelance work (from Japan) for a social network called Zaadz. 

Personal

Early years: I grew up in a military family. My mom died when I was eleven. 

Later: I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill. I spent a year abroad in England. During that time I lived in Morocco for the summer, and a winter, with my partner at the time. (He was in the Peace Corps.)

Entrepreneurial

Since 2004 I've traveled the globe. I am an entrepreneur, and my business travels with me wherever I go. During 2012 I traveled to Singapore, spent a few months in Japan, then on to Berlin, writing and doing tech research and development. As of 2013, I split my time between NYC and SF, as a technology consultant and speaker.
