Hi. I'm Gwen Bell. I write, travel, jump rope, program, drink tea (I prefer darkest of the dark pu erh, sencha, yerba mate, opinionated teas of all sort). 

Most recent interests include meat, as I've come off twelve years of vegetarianism to find out meat's pretty alright. (Ended it for a bratwurst in Berlin.)

Long held focuses: Japan, Stoicism, Buddhism (Soto Zen flavor), NVC

Current work focuses: Bitcoin, Node.js, Javascript, real-time web

Since childhood I've traveled the globe, first as a military kid, then as an adult. I've been an entrepreneur since 2005; my first, and last, job was teaching English in Japan. I've started half a dozen to a dozen companies (some of which were built with teams during sleepless weekends, so I'm not sure they count).

During 2012 I traveled and did the work in Mexico and San Francisco. I then flew to Singapore, spent a few months in Japan, and then went to Berlin.
