I write about tech because it's sexy. I'm a polyamorous bisexual cyborg. 

I'm interested in border-free, convention-free, rule-free, free as in freedom technologies. I earn and spend in Bitcoin. I code in Node.js. I live on the [command line](http://gwenbell.com/posts/digitalenvironment).

Prior to this moment, I killed off everything. All my products, most of my relationships, to live out of one bag, travel the world and learn everything I could about technology. 

I noticed no one else was building what I want, so I have to build it myself. 

I believe in a world where everything is decentralized, and we're all gender-fluid.

I want to make that world happen by doing it myself. I use as many open source, free, decentralized technologies as possible. You won't find me on the major social networks.

I program because I need to shape things from the inside, and this is the best way to shape it. Besides I always thought programmers were very sexy. That's why I decided to become one.
