Professional Brief
---

I built my first business in Japan, a yoga studio that was profitable from its second month and grew for six years. 

I've been featured on the cover of [Experience Life magazine](http://shanerichphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/bitter3.jpg) for my work. That month I shared shelf-space with Oprah. Along with Pilar Gerasimo, the magazine's director, we took the magazine on a zine tour, an idea I thought of in the shower, pitched to Pilar and she and I ran with. I had fun.

I've been honored to be named one of Fast Company's most influential women in tech. I've spoken at dozens of tech events, co-founded half a dozen companies, including Buddhist Geeks, Zen is Stupid and The Mindfulist (we closed down ZIS and TM).

I've had the rare opportunity to be a brand ambassador for Nintendo, done commercial for HP and been a panelist on a panel called, perhaps a touch cheekily, Titans of Tech. I've spoken all over the country, and taught workshops to hundreds of people. In 2009 I started a month-long annual reflection project that grew to 1,000 participants. In 2010, I rebranded it Reverb and along with Cali Harris and Kaileen Elise, we flew to Napa and grew the project to nearly 3,000 participants.

From 2011 to 2012 I traveled the globe living out of a single bag (no storage unit), supporting myself by launching ebooks and other projects, including _Digital Warriorship_, _Attention Detox, and _Reverb_ to subscriber inboxes. 

At the start of 2013 I'm building this site from scratch, learning Node.js and [speaking about git](/pages/speaking). 

Personal Bio
---

I take my life seriously. And for a lot of years, I took myself seriously, too. Somehow*, over the past two years I've managed to get over myself. 

I still take life seriously. I don't expect my life to stretch on forever. I tell the people I love that I love them. I tell the people who matter to me that they matter to me. I put my health first, the people I love second and the work third. 

I do the work every day of the week, without a break. I don't take weekends or holidays. I rest when I need to, and work when I'm not resting. I've only had one full-time job; teaching English to little kids in Japan. For only full-time jobs to have, that is the ideal one. I got to create whatever games I wanted and have little Japanese kids try them out. For pay.

That year, while I taught English, I opened a yoga studio above an izakaya. It was perpetually cold. The tatami mats we rolled our mats out on were ratty and old. Yet things went so well my compadre and I decided to move to Yokohama and do it a second time, for realzies. 

The business was a mainstay in the community for six years. When I visited Japan again in the summer of 2012, one of my former students stopped me in the street and asked when I'd be re-opening the studio. I felt so touched I was tempted to say, 'today'.

I have been wildly, deeply blessed. I was raised by my grandparents after my mom died. They could have put me in foster care, and I know some foster kids make it out ok, but I didn't have to. Instead, I ended up being able to do pretty much anything I could think up - from tap dance lessons, and yes I still remember some of my moves - to traveling the entire world. And that was just the first time (I packed too much; the second time I just took one bag).

I've taken some knocks, y'all. I'm not going to lie. I learn and then refocus on what's working, what grows me. I've had the opportunity to recover from my mistakes, thanks in large part to the [people by whom I'm influenced](/pages/influences). 

I will continue to do the work. What else can we do, other than use our lives to serve others and prepare for death? 

*Thank you, NVC.

About this Site

I've built, scrapped and started from scratch with gwenbell.com dozens of times. I built the current version of the site using Docpad, with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). I code in [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), CoffeeScript and partially in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). I host the site on a shared private VPS.
