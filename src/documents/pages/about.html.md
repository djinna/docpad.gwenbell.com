I woke up thinking about this, what Leonard Cohen said. I first read this quote I don't know where. Then I saw it again, painted on the side of a planter outside an elementary school a few doors down from that place in SF where you can get yourself dagguereotyped. Should you find yourself in need of that kind of memorialization.

I love this, what Cohen said. Though I've never been a fan of his music, this - forget your perfect offering, just ring - it's how I live. Mid-day or mid-conversation even, when it's not going as I thought it would - some unspoken thing - I'll remember something core and it's captured in there, in what Cohen said. I'll think, no, that isn't quite what I had in mind, but, let's just work with it _anyway_.

I've been watching Six Feet Under. The first time I tried to watch it, I couldn't get through the first episode. I found it agony. Now, I see the other side of the coin. Here is this family and group, beyond family, aching toward each other. Ringing the bells that still can ring. The Fishers run a funeral home, and they see every aspect of morbidity, and still they show up to it, for it, each (or at least, most) moments.

That is the thing, showing up. But there's more. It's this ongoing thing they do, that the characters do, that we do. It's how I am able to continue ringing the bells: mourning the loss. It's giving myself empathy around the cracks, around the who I thought I could be, and am not. Around what I could have done, but did not. Empathy around how I thought the day could be going, and isn't.

It is not some kind of stilted response to the world; it's an auto-adjust of my inner self to what's arising now. It's making an offering, _anyway_.
