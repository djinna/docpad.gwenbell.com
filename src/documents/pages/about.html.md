Current
-------

It's 2013. I'm back in the States after traveling the world the last year and a half. From 2011 to 2012 I lived in San Francisco, Mexico, Singapore, Japan, Germany and various other places in the States.

Now I'm building this site from scratch in Node.js, writing and [speaking about git](/pages/speaking). 

Everything I own fits into one bag. I do the work every day of the week, without a break. I put my health first, the people I love second and the work third. 

Entrepreneurial Path
--------------------

My first and only full-time job was teaching English in Japan.

That year, while I taught English, I opened a yoga studio above an izakaya. It was perpetually cold. The tatami mats we rolled our mats out on were ratty and old. Yet things went so well, I decided to do it full-time in Yokohama. 

The business was a mainstay in the community for six years. When I visited Japan again in the summer of 2012, one of my former students stopped me in the street and asked when I'd be re-opening the studio. I felt so touched I was tempted to say, 'today'.

Early Years
-----------

I was raised by my grandparents after my mom died when I was eleven. They supported me as I did anything I could think up - from tap dance and modelling lessons - to traveling the entire world. I'm grateful to them, and I let them know that.

Tech
----
 
All my work is with real-time web apps, including this site. I built the current version of this site with [DocPad](http://github.com/gwenbell/docpad.gwenbell.com). 

I code in [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), CoffeeScript and partially in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). 

I host the site on a shared private VPS. Now that I've used a VPS, I can't imagine doing it any other way.

I welcome your [pull requests](http://github.com/gwenbell/docpad.gwenbell.com) for any errors or omissions you discover on this site.
