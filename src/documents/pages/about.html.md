Everything you know about Gwen Bell is probably wrong. Just like everything you know about the Internet is probably wrong. Almost certainly wrong.

Before the age of 30, Gwen Bell did everything she wanted to do. Including, but not limited to being on the cover of a magazine, starting a yoga studio in Japan, and circumnavigating the world with all of her belongings in one bag.

If she died now, she wouldn't have any regrets.

Gwen Bell is a polyamorous bisexual cyborg. And her grandmother knows.

And still, she keeps reinventing herself. This means if you're looking for the Gwen Bell you used to know, you'd best way back machine her, because the Gwen Bell you used to know is gone now. She is not coming back.

So don't email her asking for her old work. Have the balls to experience her current work. Yes, that's scary. You can either deal or leave.

Gwen Bell eats meat. The kind that comes from dead animals.

If you take five minutes to look at the price of Bitcoins vs the price of the USD, you'll understand why Gwen only wants to earn in Bitcoins. And any paper dollars she gets, she quickly converts into a currency worth holding.

Gwen's interested in Node.js because every time she talks to a Rails developer they get defensive when Node comes up. It's a nerve, which means it'll be valuable.

The best thing Gwen did in the past year, besides traveling the entire world, was learn Git.

And Gwen talks to faeries. Actually, they talk with each other.

**I'm Gwen Bell. And I approve of this message.**
