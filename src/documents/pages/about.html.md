Hi. I'm Gwen Bell. Writer, traveler, beginner programmer, rope jumper,  tea drinker (I prefer darkest of the dark pu erh, sencha, yerba mate, opinionated teas of all sort). Most recent interests include meat, as I've come off twelve years of vegetarianism to find out meat's pretty alright. 

Long held focuses: Japan, Stoicism, Buddhism (Soto Zen flavor), NVC.

Since childhood I've traveled the globe, first as a military kid, then as an adult. I've been an entrepreneur since 2005; my first, and last, job was teaching English in Japan. I've started half a dozen to a dozen companies (some of which were built with teams during sleepless weekends, so I'm not sure they count).

During 2012 I traveled to Mexico and San Francisco. Then to Singapore, spent a few months in Japan, then on to Berlin.

As of 2013, I split my time between the coasts.
