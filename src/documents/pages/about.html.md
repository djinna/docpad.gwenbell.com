I take my life seriously. And for a lot of years, I took myself seriously, too. Somehow*, over the past two years I've managed to get over myself. 

I still take life seriously. I don't expect my life to stretch on forever. I tell the people I love that I love them. I tell the people who matter to me that they matter to me. I put my health first, the people I love second and the work third. 

I do the work every day of the week, without a break. I don't take weekends or holidays. I rest when I need to, and work when I'm not resting. I've only had one full-time job; teaching English to little kids in Japan. For only full-time jobs to have, that is the ideal one. I got to create whatever games I wanted and have little Japanese kids try them out. For pay.

That year, while I taught English, I opened a yoga studio above an izakaya. It was perpetually cold. The tatami mats we rolled our mats out on were ratty and old. Yet things went so well my compadre and I decided to move to Yokohama and do it a second time, for realzies. 

The business was a mainstay in the community for seven years. When I visited Japan again in the summer of 2012, one of my former students stopped me in the street and asked when I'd be re-opening the studio. I felt so touched I was tempted to say, 'today'.

I have been wildly, deeply blessed. I was raised by my grandparents after my mom died. They could have put me in foster care, and I know some foster kids make it out ok, but I didn't have to. Instead, I ended up being able to do pretty much anything I could think up - from tap dance lessons, and yes I still remember some of my moves - to traveling the entire world. And that was just the first time (I packed too much; the second time I just took one bag).

I've taken some knocks, y'all. I'm not going to lie. But I've also had the opportunity to recover from them, thanks largely to the [people by whom I'm influenced](/pages/influences). 

I'm not sure what's next. I only promise you I will continue to do the work. What else can we do, other than use our lives to serve others and prepare for death? 

*Thank you, NVC.
