People email me to ask about the life lists I used to create. Life lists and bucket lists aren't part of my life anymore. I don't write them. But I do write obits.

In fact, I think there's a startup in here somewhere. Someone could make a bajillion dollars. Shut down the obituary industry that props up the newspaper industry. They're surviving on obits and classifieds at this point, right?

Obituari.es - what if every person on the planet wrote their own obituary, before they died. What if it was a requirement - you hit 21, you write your own obituary? Shouldn't you be the one to determine what's said about you the day after your final day on the planet?

When I don't know what to do next, I write my obituary.

This usually takes place once a year or so. I sit down and start with the day I was born and I keep whittling it down to just the bits anyone would care about if they attended my funeral. It puts things into perspective; there's not much in there.

Over the past month or two I watched every episode of Six Feet Under. I am so grateful Alan Ball had the courage and vision to create that show. If I had a life list I'd put shaking his hand on that list.

Instead, I just have my obits, which I also delete when I delete everything, every few years. Nothing - not that bungee jumping experience, not that trip to Italy - nothing goes with you when you die.

So, isn't that a natural place from which to start living?
